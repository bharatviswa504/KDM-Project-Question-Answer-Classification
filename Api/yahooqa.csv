"When people yawn, you see that other people in the room yawn, too. Why is that?","When your body need more oxygen, you yawn.   When you yawn, you take more oxygen in the air.   If the density of the oxygen in the air becomes lower, other people (their bodies) can feel that and start to yawn to get more oxygen.  That's why yawns are contagious. Yawning is extremely contagious -- 55% of people who witness someone yawn will yawn within five minutes. If a visually impaired person hears a tape of someone yawning, he or she is likely to yawn as well. Face it, the likelihood of you making it to the end of this answer without looking like one of these gaping maws is unlikely.   Although the contagious nature of yawning is well established, we know less about why this is so. Researchers are currently giving the topic some serious attention. One theory suggests it's a holdover from a period in evolutionary history when yawning served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. A recent study postulates that contagious yawning could be part of the neural network involved in empathy.     While the mystery of contagious yawning has yet to be solved, perhaps researchers are closing in on an answer. On the other hand, given the subject matter, we wouldn't blame them for falling asleep at the wheel. In the meantime, give the yawn challenge a try -- it's tougher than it looks.","EducationReference"

"or even on some surfaces?","Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.     Since glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly.","ComputersInternet"

"I heard that tras fat is bad for the body. Why is that? Where can we find it in our daily food?","Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises bad LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease.     Until very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods.","Health"

"What are the pros and cons for web developers when using CSS","PRO: CSS is designed to allow the separation of presentation and structure. Font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes are moved into a stylesheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML code. The HTML documents become much smaller and web browsers will usually cache sites' CSS stylesheets. This leads to a reduction in network traffic and noticeably quicker page downloads.    CON:   Naming can get confusing. For example, authors might associate the class name with desired presentational attributes; for example, a CSS class to be applied to emphasized text might be named bigred, implying that it is rendered in a large red font. While such a choice of naming may be intuitive to the document author, it can cause problems if the author later decides that the emphasized text should instead be green; the author is left with a CSS class called bigred that describes something that is green.     There are bugs in CSS that you need to work out when you need it to work across multiple browsers & platforms, and its harder to debug than with a simple HTML.","ComputersInternet"

"Why is it called Heavy Metal music?","<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music#Origins_of_.22heavy_metal.22 The origin of the term heavy metal is uncertain. An early use of the term was by counter-culture writer William S. Burroughs. In his 1962 novel The Soft Machine, he introduces the character Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid. His next novel in 1964 Nova Express, develops this theme further, heavy metal being a metaphor for addictive drugs.    With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms - Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes - And the Insect People of Minraud with metal music    Burroughs, William S, (1964). Nova Express. New York: Grove Press. p. 112   Given the publication dates of these works it is unlikely that Burroughs had any intent to relate the term to rock music; however Burroughs' writing may have influenced later usage of the term.    The first use of the term heavy metal in a song lyric is the words heavy metal thunder in the 1968 Steppenwolf song Born to be Wild (Walser 1993, p. 8):    I like smoke and lightning  Heavy metal thunder  Racin' with the wind  And the feelin' that I'm under    The word heavy (meaning serious or profound) had entered beatnik/counterculture slang some time earlier, and references to heavy music typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare were already common; indeed, Iron Butterfly first started playing Los Angeles in 1967, their name explained on an album cover, Iron- symbolic of something heavy as in sound, Butterfly- light, appealing and versatile...an object that can be used freely in the imagination Iron Butterfly's 1968 debut album was entitled Heavy. The fact that Led Zeppelin (whose moniker came partly in reference to Keith Moon's jest that they would go down like a lead balloon) incorporated a heavy metal into its name may have sealed the usage of the term.    In the late 1960s, Birmingham, England was still a centre of industry and (given the many rock bands that evolved in and around the city, such as Led Zeppelin, The Move, and Black Sabbath) some people suggest that the term Heavy Metal may have some relation to such activity. Biographies of The Move have claimed that the sound came from their 'heavy' guitar riffs that were popular amongst the 'metal midlands'.    Sandy Pearlman, original producer, manager and songwriter for Blue Ayster Cult, claims to have been the first person to apply the term heavy metal to rock music in 1970.    A widespread but disputed hypothesis about the origin of the genre was brought forth by Chas Chandler, who was a manager of the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1969, in an interview on the PBS TV programme Rock and Roll in 1995. He states that ...it [heavy metal] was a term originated in a New York Times article reviewing a Jimi Hendrix performance, and claims the author described the Jimi Hendrix Experience ...like listening to heavy metal falling from the sky. The precise source of this claim, however, has not been found and its accuracy is disputed.    The first well-documented usage of the term heavy metal referring to a style of music, appears to be the May 1971 issue of Creem, in a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come. In this review we are told that Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book.    Regardless of its origin, heavy metal may have been used as a jibe initially but was quickly adopted by its adherents. Other, already-established bands, such as Deep Purple, who had origins in pop or progressive rock, immediately took on the heavy metal mantle, adding distortion and additional amplification in","EntertainmentMusic"
"what is the best photo slideshow creation application","I recently tried two products to create an end-of-the-season slideshow for my childrens swim team, MyDVD 6.1 from Sonic Solution and PictureShow 3 from ULead.    The first product, MyDVD 6.1 was easy to use, but had an unacceptable flaw and was missing a really great feature. When creating long slideshows (>99 slides), the software automatically created chapter points. The problem was, that the audio would drop out at each chapter, creating unpleasant silence at seemingly random intervals in the show (~4-5x during my slide show). Since their customer support had no recommendations on solving the problem, I was forced to look elsewhere.    The second product PictureShow 3 from Ulead, not only solved that problem, but added a feature that I really think is a must have. The feature, known as the Ken Burns effect, subtly zooms or pans the photo within the frame during playback. This allows a slide show to have a sense of motion. Everyone that viewed the DVD I created universally liked the effect and commented on the cool factor.    The UI for adding multiple audio tracks could be improved, but it does allow frame level control over positioning the audio. The DVD burning process on a large number of 8MP photos took about an hour for 260 photos, which was longer than MyDVD took for a similar task. The project templates and menu backgrounds provided for both products were a bit weak for my taste, so I used a custom background for my main menu.    All-in-all PictureShow 3 did a great job for me. The slide show was a great success and the audience of ~200-300 people who viewed it at the end of the season were impressed by the quality and I got numerous positive comments.","ComputersInternet"

"what is the meaning of life ? and please don't say it's 42.","To answer this question, you need to step back. You'll notice that most fish and frogs do not ponder life's meaning. In fact, as far as we can tell, most animals live life the best they can and don't waste much time pondering the meaning of it all. Given that we are descended from them, then an appropriate preface to your question is why do we even ask about meaning?    The best answer that anthropologists have to date is that sometime around the time that our brains started to recognize our own mortality as a concept, the behavior of ancient societies started to change. We began to bury our dead, and we began to have animistic proto-religions.    This was all sparked by the human ability to recognize cause and effect. This was essential for tool-making, and it set up the mental construct -- if this, then that. Which set up the possibility for the construct called meaning: (i.e. if I observed that, then it means that this happened). Now this type of simple causal reasoning allowed us to do all manner of things... from building stone tools toward developing science, technology and forming societies with rules, etc.     But that same reasoning applied to the question of existence becomes a lot less clear. Causal reasoning would say: if I am here, then it means that some other thing must be true. If also say, if I do something, then it is more useful (and easier to understand) if it has a meaning than if it doesn't. Now the problem is that life does not have any meaning in particular. For a while human kind got along pretty well by creating artificial systems of meaning... usually around religion or work, but the existentialists came along and pulled the rug right out from under this type of thinking.    Given that life has no absolute top-down meaning, we are left with just a few options. We can get meaning by subscribing to one of the old constructs (religion, etc), or we can do what Nietche suggested and have each individual define a system of meaning for themselves. This is easier said than done, but is probably the only way to estable meaning without subscribing to the illusions of others.    Outside of these approaches, which are decided Western in their origins, we can take an Eastern approach. This is simply to state that it not important to have meaning. Life simply is. Whether we reach this non-meaning state by flowing with the Tao, or do it by transcedental meditation that allows us to escape from our sense of self (and thus our personal need for meaning), we simply leave meaning on the doorstep. This is helpful, because the question of the meaning of life may actually just be an absurd question... and a well considered answer to an absurd question is simply absurd.    Anyhow, I hope that helps.","ArtsHumanities"

What will be the be st way to clean it?","There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning.     After turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles.     Use the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys.     Dampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys.     Use the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris.   If you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse.

"Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?","from ask yahoo...    http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html    <<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our fight or flight response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues.   People generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the fight or flight response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color.     Excessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups.     It's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness.>>","ScienceMathematics"
"recently in the market for a bbq. curious as to the pros and cons of using gas vs charcoal.","I say Charcoal ! ,but here are the pros and cons for charcoal and gas grills    Charcoal Pros    Food tastes better. That smoked flavor is impossible to duplicate with gas even if you buy the smoke products.     Charcoal grills are less expensive. A quality charcoal grill runs between $50 and $100.     It's easy to find portable charcoal grills to take on trips.    Cooking over charcoal becomes an event. If family members get hooked on cooking over charcoal, they will enjoy playing around with different techniques.     Charcoal Cons    Starting a fire can be a problem especially on damp or rainy days. It does help to keep the charcoal good and dry and an electric firestarter can also be used.    It's easy to burn food over charcoal. The heat is regulated with vents, and the cook must know how to use the vents and lid to keep the fire from flaring or burning too hot.     Coals must cool before the grill can be cleaned. This can take several hours.    A charcoal grill is messy. Grease, charcoal and ashes are not the easiest things to clean up.    Gas Pros    Starting a gas grill is as easy as turning on the gas and pushing a button. Do be careful and follow directions.    Flames and temperatures can be fine tuned with the settings on a gas grill. If you have recipes that call for temperature settings and times, then gas is super simple.    Most gas grills have two sides with separate controls, so it's easy to cook two different things at once even if they require different amounts of heat.     Clean up is really easy.    Gas Cons    Food cooked on a gas grill does not have charcoal flavor no matter what you do.    Gas grills cost more. Expect to pay at least $100 for a good gas grill. Some run in the thousands.    Most gas grills are large and are hard to take on trips.    If you run out of gas, you're out of luck","FoodDrink"

I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.    The current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for fit are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology.","ScienceMathematics"

But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. ","That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay Self Reliance, which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm).     I think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the independence of solitude). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a finished man can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced perfect sweetness comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals.

Note: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.    If you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you.

"What is an imaginary number, and how is it treated in algebra equations?","Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 (that's the square root of -1).    Don't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :)","ScienceMathematics"

"I know that the transfer rate is playing a major factor here","Many cameras use the older USB 1.1 standard for transferring data, which is slow. USB 1.1 can run in two modes (Low speed 1.5 Mbits/sec and Full speed 12.0 Mbits/sec). Your actual speed will be lower than theoretical maximum. USB 2.0 the newer standard supports 480 Mbits/sec. maximum. FireWire and PCMCIA are even faster.    With an external reader, you are not limited by what you camera supports, but by what your PC supports, so you can get higher speed interfaces such as PCMCIA, FireWire or USB 2.0, even if your camera doesn't support it. I've found USB 2.0 to provide acceptable (not blazing, but reasonable) performance, even with high-res 8MP images.","ConsumerElectronics"

"What's the best strategy to win playing Craps?","they say craps is one of those games you can come as close to reducing the house edge to 50% as possible, but the key is knowing how to bet in order to get to that point.    once the point is established, there are a few things you can do to maximize the return when it hits. you'll see most people putting a bet behind the line. for an incremental investment beyond what you've already got on the line, you'll get odds on what you bet behind the line. if the point is an even number (say 8), a small bet on the hard 8 would fetch a nice return if 4-4 is rolled.    one interesting strategy is betting the pass line, behind the pass line, place bet 5, 6 and 8 (as long as they're not the point), and the field. you'll notice you have all numbers covered except for 7. note that the amounts you bet will have to make sense. if you only placed $6 on 8, putting $10 in the field doesn't make sense since when an 8 hits, you'll lose 3 (win $7 from the place bet and lose $10 on the field). notice that as long as your betting levels make sense AND the shooter doesn't crap out, you get paid.    most will say that one roll bets like the field, CnEs, horn bets, etc. are sucker bets since you're betting on a specific combination for only the next roll.    main take away should be that you have to spread your money around and play more than the pass line to win.","GamesRecreation"
"Is coffee bad for your skin? Should I cut back if I want beautiful, youthful skin?","There are pros and cons in using coffee for skin care.    Pros  - coffee contains antioxidant that can help fight skin cancer.  - some preliminary studies show that topically applied coffee can yield beautiful skin.    Cons  - coffee is a mild diurectic. If drunk in large quantity, coffee can cause dehydration of the skin.  - drinking coffee can interfere with a good night's sleep, which is essential to good skin.    So drinking small amount of coffee shouldn't affect the health of skin. But at large quantity, you should talk to your doctor first to find out if the antioxidant benefit is worth it. There are other ways to prevent skin cancer. One of the best ways is to use a broad spectrum sunscreen everyday even when the weather is cloudy.","BeautyStyle"
"Silicon Valley is one of the wealthiest areas of the country, with a highly educated, ethnically diverse population. Why is it a total cultural wasteland? Why isn't there a Medici, or Andrew Carnegie, or Paul Mellon of Silicon Valley? This seems counterintuitive to me.","In short: cars and zoning laws.     Culture is a vaguely defined concept, but in my definition it refers to the creative expression of humanity, i.e. culture opposes nature in that it is what is made, not found. Included is the arts, the architecture, the built environment, the civic life of the streets, the events taking place in the community, and cities have traditionally been the places where much of this activity is concentrated. Thus your recognition of San Francisco as where the concentration of culture in the Bay Area.     It is a much repeated fact that the entirety of Medieval Florence would fit into one average Phoenix area intersection.     Silicon Valley has the misfortune of having come of age after WWII, and post-WWII cities were environments designed for cars and not for people. Cars insulate people from one another, prevent the fruitful mixing of different classes and different races. Environments built for cars include parking lots, strip malls, and houses dominated by garages and not front porches, and front porches are a big part of street level society.     Cars lead to self-segregation almost as much as suburban development does. Suburban development is largely segregated by income level: a $100,000 house is never built next to a $500,000 house, and god forbid if an apartment building went up next door. And no one needs to point out that all the houses look more or less the same.     Building a city, in the traditional understanding of what a city comprises, is no longer legal in most parts of the country. Zoning laws of most cities prohibit the building of streets with back alleys, or foregrounding the culture of the street over the need to park. It's not possible to build traditional streets with retail on the first floor, offices on the second, and living spaces above. It's not possible to put commerce and residential together. Even in big cities, there is often a dead downtown -- after work, everyone leaves and the streets die.    You can see an effort to build a New Urbanist street in the case of Santana Row, in San Jose. That it feels a lot like a shopping mall denigrates the experience somewhat, but if other developers in surrounding blocks picked up the same torch, and mom and pop stores could move in instead of big box retail, you'd have the beginnings of a new town.

"I'm staring to edit movie clips and was wondering which format would be better for me.","There is a confusing alphabet soup of acronyms for video. In the list above, you actually have three different types of entities: standards organizations (MPEG), encodings (MPEG2, WMV) and containers (AVI, WMV).    From the standards committees, comes specs to implement conforming encoders/decoders for multiple variations of the standards. For example, MPEG2 or MPEG4, which can be implemented with various profiles and levels. Levels are used to support variations such as standard definition vs. high-definition.    Container types serve to make it even more confusing. Think of a container type as the file extension/file format for all those audio and video files. Many types of containers support multiple types of encodings inside. For example, the popular .avi file format can contain different types of video encodings. Also, keep in mind that .mpg files can also contain different audio endodings (e.g. Dolby Digital vs. PCM vs. MPEG1-Layer2)    Lastly, some people just have to be different, like Microsoft. The WMV format can be thought of as both a container and an encoding. It's a container, because it's a file format for packaging video data. It's an encoding, because Microsoft implemented a non-standard variant of MPEG4.    Now, back to practical issues. First, decide if you want your video to make DVD's or to use on your PC. If it's DVD's, the answer is simple, because DVD's are MPEG2 currently. Use MPEG2, unless you want to hassle re-encoding. If it's to use on a computer or some other special application, then you have more options. The two big variables are quality and size. Newer encoding formats such as MPEG4 and WMV achieve significantly better compression, without sacrificing quality. You may find better tools available for MPEG2 though, since it is the reigning king. Look for the newer encodings to blow it away in the future, especially as the move to high-definition video takes hold.","ConsumerElectronics"

"I would like to know how a black hole can possibly be formed. Are there any experimental evidence of such creation?","The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.    Not sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.    Fun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in.","ScienceMathematics"

"what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process?","Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.    Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium.","ScienceMathematics"

"what is the reason that prevents any particle in the universe to move faster then the speed of light","It is impossible *as far as we know*, which doesn't rule it out in the long run. Some scientists claimed to have gotten around the limit already: http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/faster_than_c_000719.html. Mostly, those who postulate the existence of particles that travel faster than the speed of light, also admit that it is impossible for said particles to cross the speed of light boundry.    However, to explain the current rule, you can look to Einstein's theory of relativity. There are many equations, but they basically say that as velocity approaches the speed of light, your mass would increase to infinity, your length would decrease to infinity, and time would dialate to infinity (stand still). We cannot mathematically explain anything crossing the speed of light boundry. To be more precise than saying infinity, what actually happens is that a term in the equation becomes a complex number, causing a singularity.    Traditional methods of propulsion (rocket engines, jets, ion engines, solar sails, etc) are of no use either. This is becasue that the amount of energy necessary to increase one's velocity increases as you approach the speed of light. When you are very close to the speed of light, in order to speed up more, you would need vast amounts of power. We just don't have the technology to do it that way.","ScienceMathematics"

As fossil fuel prices rise and technology improves so-called alternative energy sources become more cost effective, but the crossover point still appears to be several years in the future.    Forcing expensive alternative technologies on the market before they are economically viable simply raises electricity prices for homeowners--this is part of the reason CA electric rates were so far above the national average in the 1990's, opening the door for Enron and like to make their ill-fated arbitrage plays...","ScienceMathematics"

As long as it's not significantly off, you should be OK - most electronic devices are built to be fairly tolerant of electrical variances.

"What makes a Formula1 car a fast car?","Let me break it down-    Engine- 3 liter V10. Approximately 900+ hp, 19,000 rpm. The engine weighs about 200 lbs. It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.    Brakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast. These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make. They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing. The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability. As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking. An average person would black out in an F1 car.    Aerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is. These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers. The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed. It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.    Traction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning. The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.    Transmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions. The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second. All the driver does is pull a lever. The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel.     What doesn't make the cars fast-    Tires- The tires are grooved to limit traction. If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash. Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.    Wheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology    Brakes- As stated earlier, size limited. Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994).","Sports"

"What is the history behind it?","here is what the Net has to offer:    http://signalfan.freeservers.com/history.html    As early as the mid-1800's, the railroads in both England and the United States were using lanterns, hung from crossbars, to give railroad men a signal visible by night as well as by day. For the control or direction of street traffic by colored lights however, England appears to have led the way. The worlds first traffic signal using colored lights was installed in December of 1868 at the intersection of George and Bridge Streets near the Houses of Parliament. It had been installed in response to a suggestion by a select committee that railway signal gear be adapted to street traffic. It's purpose was to give protection to members of Parliament and lesser street crossers at a point where vehicle traffic was very heavy.      The resulting signal was invented by J.P. Knight, a railroad signaling engineer. Shown here by a surviving drawing, it was to have been an imposing 22' high and crowned with a gas light. The semaphore arms, when extended horizontally, meant Stop. When lowered to a droopy 45° angle, meant Caution. At night, a green light and red light were used in conjunction with the arms.    Although it is entirely possible and probable that other attempts were made to control traffic by colored lights after this London experience, no recorded account has come down to us until the earlier part of the 20th century..    you can also refer to:   http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2004/Projects/J0332.pdf#search='red%20is%20stop%20green%20is%20go%20history'","EducationReference"
"When was it, where was it and by whom?","First, I would never say that a theory has been proven. There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.    Now to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.","ScienceMathematics"

"Why hybrid cars gas mileage is better in city ?","hybrid cars save energy in two ways:  1.by storing energy from the breaks 2.by engaging the gas motor only in it's most effective work RPM meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed (close to the most efficient motor RPM) Having said the above, driving in the city almost never gets you to the efficient RPM.  Also- it is true that the same energy that is being stored in the cars' battery needed to be generated by chemic energy. The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco, the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.  You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.

"Can we capture light in a container? Will it run and shine forever? What kind of internal material we should use in order to do that?","So the answer to your specific question is 'no'. The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out. There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.    Some radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.    Now, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam. If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place. Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.    Once the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way. Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material. The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.","ScienceMathematics"

"can an animal feel regrets , compassion, sad, fear etc?","It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations. Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on. On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.    One possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state. With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.    My opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.     If the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious. If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses.","ScienceMathematics"

"What is the history behind it?","The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical. Here's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. Elevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. Then an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator. When they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights? This lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. They also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. t room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay? By installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all. ","BusinessFinance"
"what would be the ultimate gift for a baby shower? Can you name some things that you got that were great?","Sometimes, people who are expecting children register at baby stores, just like they do for weddings. So you can check with the host/hostess of the baby shower and find out if the expecting mother registered at Babys R Us or Gap Kids or some other baby store. Registry gifts are easy because you know you're not buying a duplicate and that you're getting the mom something she really wants and will need.     If there is no registry, you might ask the person hosting the shower for ideas. Often the host or hostess is very close to the expecting mother, and will have inside information about what she wants or already has.    If these fail, you have two options with which you can't go wrong: cute outfits or practical accesories. Cute outfits for newborn-sized children are great for the show-off ooh-ahh factor during the baby shower, as well as serving the long-term utilitarian puropse of clothing the baby. Practical gifts will probably attract less attention at the shower, but will be infintely helpful to parents later. Parents can never have too many baby washcloths, bibs, onesies, and newborn socks. I wouldn't suggest buying anything that comes in many different models, such as bottles or high chairs, though, because parents-to-be often have very specific requirements for these types of items and it's easy to incorrectly guess at their desires.","PregnancyParenting"

"How can pilots tell when it is coming up? How can they tell how severe it will be? How about in dry/hot climates?","Turbulences are mostly caused by wind shear and pressure differences    Pilots don't really know when they are going to encounter turbulences. But they can have a good estimation about it from several inputs:  1. Before any flight a pilot will call the FAA briefing center and will get a detailed weather forecast along his route.   a. Within that briefing you get all the estimated turbulences with an up-to-date other pilot reports.  b. You will also be notify on the altitude, direction, and location of the jet stream which is a major cause of turbulences  c. A bad weather activity is, of course, also a major cause- cumulonimbus (active storm clouds), thunder storms, hurricanes etc will not come without turbulences in there close environment   2. By looking out side, sometimes you can spot indications of wind shear such as- differences in the type of clouds.  3. many airplanes carry a weather radar to track bad weather activity    To sum it up- Pilot cannot tell the exact location and the severity of the turbulences along his route.

Their approach kept all of the chemicals out of the common areas and left no dangerous ant traps hanging around.

"retrofit versus new windows?","I went the window retrofit route based on a recommendation from a friend. So far, after ~4 years all is well. No leaks, no problems. I was reluctant to redo stucco around the house and concerned the results wouldn't look good.    A few things to consider. First, retrofit windows look different, since they have a wider border and mount within the existing legacy frames. It's a matter of personal taste, but I think the wider borders actually look nice.    Other factors to consider are the window frame color and vinyl vs. aluminum. Our house originally had brown trimmed windows, since a previous owner had already retrofitted some windows. We decided to stick with the same color trim. The issue is that the colored ones only come in aluminum. I think this is because they are actually anodized for the coloring. I've heard vinyl has better insulation properties and had we not already had some windows complete, white vinyl would've been my choice.    Hopefully you are getting doubled paned windows, if not I'd highly recommend it. Check out the wndows to see if they use argon between the panes. This seems to be the gas of choice, since inert gasses provide the best insulation characteristics.     Lastly, check out the low-e or low-emissivity glass. Basically this is a coating on the glass that reflects long wave infra-red radiation for better heat/cold management. Cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.","HomeGarden"

"How do I reset the root password in Linux?","Here's how to do it.  I would have had to dig up the CD's (who knows where they are) and do a recovery that way, or download something from Tom's Root and Boot Site. I had access to the Grub loader, so I had it easy.    If you've lost your root password, you might be able to recover it this way. However, some systems are protected with boot loader passwords that won't let you do that without THAT password. If the boot loader is password protected, you need to boot from other media - for newer systems, the install CD probably has the recovery tools for that (linux rescue for example).    But let's try it the easy way first. The first thing to try is to boot to single user mode. This MIGHT not work for you, because your system might be configured to still ask for a root password to get to single user mode. If that's the case, we'll use another trick that replaces init with /bin/bash.    First, try single user. If you don't see either a LILO or GRUB boot screen, try hitting CTRL-X to get one. If it's LILO, just type linux single and that should do it (assuming that linux is the lilo label). If GRUB, hit 'e, then select the kernel line, hit e again, and add single (or just 1) to the end of the line. Press ENTER, and then b to boot. (More modern grub uses a to append to the boot line)    You should get a fairly normal looking boot sequence except that it terminates a little early at a bash prompt. If you get a Give root password for system maintenance, this isn't going to work, so see the init version below.    If you do get the prompt, the / filesystem may not be mounted rw (although mount may say it is). Do    mount -o remount,rw /  If that doesn't work (it might not), just type mount to find out where / is mounted. Let's say it is on /dev/sda2. You'd then type:    mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda2  If you can do this, just type passwd once you are in and change it to whatever you like. Or just edit /etc/shadow to remove the password field: move to just beyond the first : and remove everything up to the next :. With vi, that would be /: to move to the first :, space bar once, then d/: and ENTER. You'll get a warning about changing a read-only file; that's normal. Before you do this, /etc/shadow might look like:    root:$1$8NFmV6tr$rT.INHxDBWn1VvU5gjGzi/:12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543  bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  and after, the first few lines should be:    root::12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543  bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  You'll need to force the write: with vi, :wq!. (If that still doesn't work, you needed to do the -o remount,rw, see above).    Another trick is to add init=/bin/bash (LILO linux init=/bin/bash or add it to the Grub kernel line). This will dump you to a bash prompt much earlier than single user mode, and a lot less has been initialized, mounted, etc. You'll definitely need the -o remount,rw here. Also note that other filesystems aren't mounted at all, so you may need to mount them manually if you need them. Look in /etc/fstab for the device names.    Keep this in mind if you have a Linux machine in a publically accessible place : without more protection, it's not usually hard to recover a lost root password, which means it's just as easy for someone to CHANGE it, or access root without your knowlege.    Another way to do this is to remove the password from /etc/shadow. Just in case you screw up, I'd copy it somewhere safe first. You wan","ComputersInternet"

"I believe Cartalk said its ok, but they are just radio personalities....","While it is true that putting premium gas in a car designed for regular is a waste of money, the opposite is not true. Contrary to popular belief, premium gas has the same or even less energy than regular, the sole difference being the temperature at which it will ignite.     Many cars that require premium gas require it because their engines run at high temperatures and/or compression and regular gas will ignite prematurely causing detonation, which sounds like a knocking in the engine. Modern cars do have sensors which detect this condition and will dial back the power accordingly to prevent damage but the point is that the condition has to occur for the engine to respond.     In effect, a tiny amount of damage can occur every time to fill your car with regular gas. While putting regular in by accident once in a while is probably fine, the effect of the damage is cumulative and probably not worth the couple hundred you save every year. If you have a turbocharged car then you should NEVER put in regular gas. Ever. The same is true for high revving, high output Honda VTEC engines like the S2000 or Prelude.

"How do I get a sticker off of a car window (plastic part)? Nail polish remover seems risky?","Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue. Soak the area, and wipe it away. It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.    Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic. I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful.     In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape. Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly. Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it. This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective.","CarsTransportation"

"I've wondered about wearing black for mourning in the western countries(like US) and black is also the most popular color for evening formal wear, celebratory events (parties, dinners etc. Is there a sigificance to the color black in being appropriate for mourning and celebration?","Color is often associated with the reflection of one's mood, taste, style, especially in social gatherings. Given this, any color worn other than white or black are going to reflect one's cheerful moods or their taste. This is true in some asian countries. Given this we are only left with white or black.  In India, people often times wear white during funerals and deaths. You can watch this on Television whenever a celebrity dies and people gather dressed in White. Reason for choosing white is that it's BLAND - not cheerful, not colorful, just plain mood. In the olden days (about 50 years or back) widows used to wear white dress as well - reflective of lack of cheerful life due to loss of their husband.    Seems like in USA the culture is to use Black to reflect lack of cheer, giving conservative look.

"puppies sniffing my guest","That is how dogs greet each other. Apparently the anal gland of every dog has a unique scent, and that's how they recognize each other. Your dog sniffing the privates of your guests is the result of canine instinct and is completely normal. The dog will not outgrow this behavior but like most behaviors, can be shaped so that your dog does not do this.     To stop this, NEVER react by yelling when your dog greets people in this manner. Believe or not, this is a reinforcing behavior since dogs generally interpret any strong response as a good one. Next time your dog does this, make sure your guests turn around and walk away from your dog. Dogs do not like being ignored and will generally stop behavior that results in a lack of attention.","Pets"

"Seems like every time we have a hot spell, people say it's global warming. When it gets cold they never talk about global cooling. Aren't we just seeing normal temperature fluctuations? Isn't it true that if the the planet was actually getting warmer more water would evaporate into the atmosphere, creating clouds and cooling things down again?","It's absolutely true that our recorded experience of the Earth's weather patterns is extremely limited. It's also true that through studies of geology, tree ring signatures, ice cores, and like, we see strong evidence that the Earth has had many, many cycles of hot times and ice ages.    Most scientists I've read on the subject agree that there are typical cycles and that we are likely in a cycle that is moving from cold to warmer since the last ice age. They also think that as the Earth gets warmer it typically then gets colder soon after because of evaporation, clouds, changes to winds & ocean currents, etc. Many scientists also believe that this trend does occur naturally and independenly of man. That said, many believe that we are accelerating it, and that's the big concern. They're worried that the acceleration could trigger large-scale changes more quickly than they would normally happen. And, faster changes mean that life might not have enough time to adapt.    For example, there's pretty strong evidence that a ~5 degree increase in the temperature of our polar waters could seriously impact the yearly cycles of algae/plankton blooms that form the basis of the ocean food chain. If this occurs over, say, 12,000 years, the algae/plankton would likely adapt and still bloom, or even move and bloom elsewhere. If it happens over, say, 100 years, the algae/plankton might not be able to adapt, and the snowball effect of such a loss could cascade through the entire ocean and land-based ecologies disrupting semi-stable systems in a catastrophic way.    So, the issue is not that we don't know about and expect *natural* global warming, it's that we don't know what happens if said global warming happens more quickly than it would naturally. And, as they say, what you don't know can kill ya.","Environment"

For example, UC Berkeley is generally considered the best public university because it is the most competitive and probably has the highest number of faculty with various honors such as Nobel Prizes. But if, for example, you're interested in veterinary medicine or oenology (science of winemaking), UC Davis is better. If you want a greater focus on undergraduate education, many students prefer UC Santa Cruz.    In addition to the other private universities that have been mentioned (Stanford, Caltech, and USC), there is a group of small private colleges called the Claremont consortium that is very highly rated. It includes Pomona College, Scripps College, and Harvey Mudd College. Each of these colleges has a special focus, but students in all of them get to share facilities and cross-register for classes.","EducationReference"
"Can anyone give any suggestion?","Growing Vanilla is non-trivial. It's an orchid vine that originated in the rainforests of southeast Mexico, so requires a consistent tropical environment to grow well. As a result, most people grow them in greenhouses where they can control the temp, shade and humidity (for example, they don't like temperatures under about 55 degrees F, so no outside growing in California).    On top of the greenhouse, the pollination process as well as the harvesting & preparation are extremely time intensive. I.e., you will need to be the bee (using a syringe) and then time the harvesting just right to get the beans before they open so the vanilla isn't lost.    If you're serious about giving it a try I'd suggest that you drill around Amazon for a book on it to make sure and get all of the details just right.","HomeGarden"
"i heard about those, but have just a vague understanding about them.","The source of Gamma Ray bursts is currently unknown. They are a surprising phenomenon because gamma rays are so powerful that very few events could cause them. They have also only been recently discovered by projects like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and appear to be coming from all directions, not just in the galactic plane.    This would indicate a phenomenon that has extra-galactic origins... for example, activity inside of an active galactic nuclei, or quasars.    Because they happen at random intervals, abd are ephemeral (often just a few seconds), and the scopes used to capture them are not tightly directional, we don't have any instruments currently that can figure out exactly what they are.

"Whereas reading books isn't in general (no doubt there are some avid readers but I am talking about the majority).","I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information.

However, Mark Twain had a point when he said The coldest Winter I ever spent was Summer in San Francisco.    This is because the warm air from inland (where it gets quite hot in the Summer) clashes with the cold air from the surrounding Pacific Ocean and the SF Bay. When that happens, fog forms. Further explanation from http://kids.earth.nasa.gov: At night, the ground surface cools by radiating heat to space. Air near the ground cools to the dew point temperature, causing water in the air to condense.    Sure it's cold, but fog can be quite beautiful and atmospheric.

"Why does it seem that most of the diets don't work on over weight people?","I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets.   Another major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. By that, the government actually encourages obesity. Why would someone even try to get better?   Authorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.  We should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. There is the health costs, taxes lost and so on.  I say- do what you can to leave healthy life, and don’t give up","Health"

"One would expect that it would be of an interest of states to have alternate resources.","California electricity is generated by several sources, including hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas). The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear). As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.    Incidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies.

"When do you use a semicolon instead of a colon?","While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar, modern usage seems to be diverging, with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations.     Semicolons have always been used in a manner very similar to commas, but with greater weight. That is, the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence, dividing clauses which are longer and more independent, while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.    Continuing up the continuum, colons are weightier than semicolons, but less so than periods. They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons, but not as final as periods. Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically, while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.    However, in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon. The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation. For example, the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters. It is used to introduce quotes, separating the source from the quoted text. A colon is used to introduce a list, included bulleted lists. A colon is used to separate the parts in a multipart title, such as Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books or Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't.","SocietyCulture"

"When I studied Spanish it essentially washed the French from my brain. Now I want to study Italian, but it is so close to Spanish that I worry that it will obliterate whatever Spanish is left in my head. What are strategies for saving one language when learning another one?","The best way (only way?) not to forget languages is to speak them with native people for a few years. This is possible only if you live in a cosmopolitan environment where you naturally bump into people who can speak only one of the languages that you are trying to develop and not the other ones.    This is the reason why we find street vendors in countries who travel between the borders of the regions where diverse languages are spoken, to be reasonably fluent in many languages at the same time. This is because the guy wants to make a sale and he can do it better if he can make a conversation in your native language. He may also end up meeting folks that can speak only their tongue and nothing else and hence the vendor ends up picking up that language. For example if you happen to be travelling between Germany, Switzerland & France borders then you may end up speaking German and French and still retain both.     Bottomline is you would have to speak the language with people who can understand only that language and not any other language that you know pretty well.

"How is it contagious...","Found an interesting article on this...    Yawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious.     There is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out? to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest.     This is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.","ScienceMathematics"

"How to grow peppers?","Peppers are easy to grow and maintain.     1. Start your peppers from seed.   2. Gather your containers and start planting. Fill the container with a well-draining potting soil, and sow the seeds two to a hole, water to dampen, then place the containers inside a plastic bag until they germinate. Peppers LOVE heat, so speed the germination by placing them in a warm spot. Once the sprouts have poked their way through the soil, remove the bag and place the seedlings where they can get adequate sun or artificial light, at least 8 hours a day.   3. Once you have healthy, sturdy seedlings with at least 4 inches of growth, you can move them into the garden.   4. Give them what they need, steadily. Be sure to fertilize with a phosphorus rich fertilizer once during initial growth, and again at pepper production time, after the blossoms have set. If the weather turns suddenly cool, cover the soil under the peppers with black plastic to help hold in the heat. Be sure to remove the plastic as temperatures increase. It's also important to water steadily, but to not OVER water peppers. An inch a week is the rule, and it should be done all at once.

Hold one chopstick between your thumb and middle finger. Position the chopstick so that it lies at the base of your thumb (on the joint) and at the lower joint of the middle finger. This chopstick shouldn't touch the forefinger.  2. Place the other chopstick between your thumb and forefinger. The side of the chopstick should rest against the tip of your thumb; the top of the chopstick should rest against the pad of your forefinger.  3. Be sure the tips of the chopsticks are parallel.  4.

"How to unclog a tub?","1. Get a pair of tweezers or an old small scissors in order to lift long hair out from the drain, or whatever may be causing the clog.     Try running hot water down the drain, and see if it goes down quickly. If it is still too slow, and collecting in the tub, try putting a half-cup of baking soda in the drain, then pour a half-cup of vinegar immediately afterwards. Then rinse with water.    2. Another way to unclog a tub is to use chemical products such as Drano or LiquidPlumr. Just don't use vinegar and then use the chemical product at the same time!     3. Have you tried using a plunger?

"How often? everyday? every other day? For how long? How much do I need to water?","To determine how often the lawn needs water, dig around grass roots. Irrigate when the top 2 inches of soil become dry and crumbly. Water slowly and deeply, wetting the grass down to the deep root level. Frequent light sprinklings cause shallow root growth and will not result in healthy lawns. Overwatering the lawn can reduce oxygen levels to the roots, and will stifle good growth. Further, overwatering encourages some lawn weeds such as buttercups, annual blue grass, and speedwell.","HomeGarden"

"I wasn't particulary impressed with No Country for old Men. It might be a stylistic thing. I really love Suttree and Blood Meridian, which were longer, denser and more florid and metaphorical. I like the works of youthful rage (McCarthy, Beethoven, de Kooning, Picasso) over the later works almost as a rule. The ones who rage to the end are rare: William Burroughs, Louise Bourgeois... <br><br>Shakespeare, as with most things, is an exception. The Tempest was a masterpiece which appeared at the end of his career. Any other examples you can think of?","Pete Townshend. Laurence Olivier. Kurt Vonnegut. Stevie Wonder. Truman Capote. It is sad to compare these artists' later work with the passion and excitement of their youthful art.     Perhaps it has to do with Western culture's obsession with youth, but it does seem that our best artists do their greatest work when they are young and angry and fighting the establishment. Would we still hold up James Dean as an icon of cool if he had grown old enough to guest star on 'Dynasty' with his 'Giant' co-star Rock Hudson? No way. By the same token, John Lennon will always be cooler than Paul McCartney because he was killed before he could start churning out pop fluff and become 'Sir John'.

"My vacuum cleaner sucks! It sucks dirt weakly.","Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find. Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands. Reassemble all the parts.     You may also have to replace the drive belt.    1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.    2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.     3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.     4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.     5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush.

You quickly fry the ingredients in a large pan over high heat while constantly stirring to preserve its flavor, color and texture and keep the vegetables crisp.     You prepare your meat or chicken. Cut the meat or chicken into thin bite-size slices and marinate to protect it from overcooking. The marinade can be made with a variety of liquids depending on the flavor you are trying to obtain. Typical marinade ingredients include chicken or beef stock, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, corn starch, brown sugar, rice wine or dry sherry. Marinate for a least one hour, longer is better.     Then, prepare your aromatic mixture consisting of finely chopped herbs and spices that will add flavor and aroma to the stir-fry. Typical aromatics include garlic, scallions, red pepper flakes, shallots, and chili peppers to name a few.     Next, prepare your vegetables by cutting them into small pieces and separating according to their cooking times. Slower cooking vegetables like asparagus and green beans will be added before faster cooking vegetables like pea pods and tomatoes.

"Why are there two Supermen and why is one older than the other?","It's relatively simple. Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters. Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.     Earth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound description. Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism. Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths. Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity. Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.    Earth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since Crisis; once in 1999's Kingdom Come, and most recently in 2005's Infinite Crisis. What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing. Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear, but longtime fans can always hope.","EntertainmentMusic"

"What are the necessary qualifications and the process to get on the high court?","There are nine seats on the United States Supreme Court. You must be nominated by the President of the United States, and confirmed by a majority in the U.S. Senate. Justices are appointed for life (except in cases of retirement or impeachment).    It is not necessary for that person to have experience as a judge (George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?ei=UTF-8&fl=0&fr=slv5-&p=harriet+miers+%22supreme+court%22  is not the first time a non-judge has been nominated), just a solid legal mind. Generally when a President chooses a nominee, he will look for someone whose ideals and worldview match his own. Gerald Ford famously did not make an idealogical choice when he appointed John Paul Stevens (http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c11_f.html)   and in subsequent years was rather disappointed at some of Stevens' decisions.

"How to pick cantaloupes?","More ways to pick the right cantaloupes:    1. The best thing you can do is smell. This doesn't apply for watermelons. Watermelons are described below. As for cantaloupe: don't look, don't touch, just smell. Ripe cantaloupe smells very sweet and nice. Sniffing out the most aromatic one is the smartest way to pick a cantaloupe or honeydew.   2. Thump test: hold your dominant hand as if ready to knock on a door. Deliver two or three good thumps to the round side of a melon. The sound should be deep and thick, indicating a dense, full fruit. A higher hollow sound can mean unripeness.   3. If a honeydew is beige-skinned with distinct green veins it's probably not ripe yet. If it has a pale yellow color with bright, lemon-colored areas you probably have found a good one.   Cantaloupes are unripe when the skin beneath the textured web is green. Cantaloupes are ripe when orange or gold.   4. Another mark of desirability is a patch that's slightly flat and bleached in color. Melons that develop on the vine flatten under their own weight, and lose color where they sit on hot soil. In general, stem ends should be moist, not moldy. A good melon is firm, but not rock hard. It yields very slightly to pressure but has no soft spots.   5. Ripe cantaloupes rattle only occasionally, so it's an unreliable indicator.     To determine ripeness of cantaloupes and honeydews in order to pick them from the plant, the following indices of maturity are known:     Grasp it firmly, give a tug and a twist. If it falls easily off the vine into your hand, it's ripe.","FoodDrink"

Citrus trees should be watered so that the soil is dry to the touch between waterings. Also, it's recommended that you don't allow them to sit in standing water that has collected in the saucer.

"What does the raining of frogs mean in the movie Magnolia?","Raining Frogs has ranked among commonly disputed phenomenon for some time. Some believe it to be nothing more than urban myth. Others report actual scientific evidence depicting its plausibility due to heavy winds and other meteorological means. Either way, this dual interpretation is sort of the point behind its inclusion in the film, because it can mean multiple things to multiple people, depending on how they choose to look at it.   Many attentive viewers have noted that the raining of frogs in the third act of the film bears religious connotation, which is referenced several times throughout the film. This is mostly done through the repeated appearances of the numbers 8 and 2 culminating the use of Exodus 8:2 on an advertisement poster at a bus stop (during the scene in which John C. Reilly's character, Jim Kurring, is driving down Magnolia Blvd. and finds William H. Macy's Quiz Kid Donnie Smith breaking and entering just prior to the rain of frogs sequence). The passage referenced reads: And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.  Despite the biblical implication above, and the address of coincidental yet scientifically feasible phenomena via Stanley Berry and the opening narration by Ricky Jay, the inclusion of the frogs in this sequence seems to stem more from the thematic devices within the film, calling into question strange phenomena and urban myths laced with coincidence, and equating them to struggles of a personal nature. Each character in the film wrestles with letting go of personal and emotional baggage in differing circumstances, and the frogs raining down seems to indicate both a collective release in many cases (as in Frank T.J. Mackey’s final emotions regarding his dying father Earl Partridge, and in turn Earl's subsequent release into death), and an awakening sign to others (the Gator Family, and Quiz Kid Donnie Smith).  All of the characters are affected in some personal and emotion fashion via this shared experience, and each one interprets it differently. The inclusion of biblical and scientific support (specifically the work of Charles Fort, whom Stanley Berry is seen reading in the library at one point in the film) is meant to offer up evidence of both sides of the belief spectrum leaving the characters, and us viewers, to glean from the experience and interpret it for ourselves.","EntertainmentMusic"
"How do I make fluffy scrambled eggs?","According to Food Network, use milk to make fluffier scrambled eggs.     Here's a recipe from the Food Network Kitchens site:    Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk in the milk. Season the eggs with salt and beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until combined. Over-beating makes the eggs thin. As the eggs cook, the milk turns into steam, puffing up the eggs as they firm. The traces of sugar, fats and protein in the milk also help to make larger curds. The larger the curds, the more steam is trapped. Water will dilute the flavor and they will not be as soft and fluffy. Don’t add more than five teaspoons of milk per egg, because the eggs can’t absorb all that milk.     Cook the eggs in a heavy nonstick pan or a well-seasoned pan to prevent the eggs from sticking. Don’t use too large a pan either, or the batter will spread out and cook too quickly. An eight-inch pan works well for two eggs, a 10-inch pan for four eggs. Preheating the pan over a medium heat also keeps the eggs from sticking.     Add butter or oil – about a teaspoon per egg – and heat it. Add the eggs and let them begin to set; then, with a heatproof rubber spatula, push the curds to one side and let the uncooked eggs spread over the surface of the pan. Repeat this action until the eggs are cooked to the desired degree of doneness – eggs taste best when slightly moist.","FoodDrink"
"Why does eating spicy food make you crave for something sweet?","We crave for the endorphin rush. After eating something spicy, our nerves feel pain. These pain signals are immediately transmitted to the brain. The brain interprets this signal and automatically releases endorphins (the body's natural pain killer). Once the endorphins kick in, it creates a temporary feeling of euphoria. We then begin to crave for this feeling.     The endorphins control our inclination toward certain kinds of foods. One of our strongest cravings is for sweets. Sweets like chocolate causes an endorphin rush. Chocolate is the most popular endorphin-producing food on Earth. Chocolate is derived from cacao beans that were revered by the Aztecs, who believe that eating chocolate would confer wisdom and vitality. In addition to sugar, caffeine and fat, chocolate contains more than 300 different constituent compounds, including anandamide, a chemical that mimics marijuana's soothing effects on the brain.","Health"

This is done so that they can judge the next wine completely on its own (without having the taste of the previous wine in their mouth).

According to WholeHealthMD, they supply a healthy amount of dietary fiber (both soluble and insoluble), iron, potassium, and B vitamins. The World's Healthiest Foods points out that raisins have been the object of phytonutrient research primarily for their unique phenol content, which helps prevent oxygen-based damage to cells in the body. WHF also notes that these dried grapes are one of the top sources of the trace mineral boron. Studies have shown that boron provides protection against osteoporosis and reproduces many of the positive effects of estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women. So the tiny, wrinkled currants you're used to seeing only in scones and stuffing are actually very good for you!

"How to choose a proper lighting for the living room?","1. Choose lighting according to its application. General, or ambient, lighting brightens an entire room indirectly; task lighting helps you read, sew, cook or do paperwork under focused illumination; accent lighting spotlights decorative objects.     2. Experiment with different bulbs to achieve the brightness, warmth of tone or clarity of light you're looking for. Warm incandescent, color-true halogen or super-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs are new on the market. The final type lasts up to 10 times longer but uses only one-third of the energy--for example, a 25-watt compact fluorescent is as bright as a 75-watt incandescent bulb.     3. Use recessed lights, floor lamps and soffit uplights for entertaining and watching television instead of a harsh, single ceiling light. Add table lamps for reading or sewing, and track lights to accent art and architectural features.     4. Shop for style and construction as well as price. Fixtures sold at lighting showrooms may cost more, but usually are higher quality, and lighting consultants can offer design advice. Custom finishes, blown-glass shades and halogen bulbs also add to the cost of fixtures.","HomeGarden"
"I read that those with this distinction are able to identify vintage, varietal, etc of wines on tasting and that becoming a Master of Wine is very difficult to achieve. How does one become a master of wine? What credentials do they have? And what resources are at their disposal for their wine education--presumably not everyone can afford or have the opportunity to taste rare wines, etc.","Master of Wine is an internationally recognised qualification (MW) conferred by The Institute of Masters of Wine, founded in 1955 and based in the United Kingdom. The qualification is achieved through extensive examination and dissertation, and is generally regarded in the wine industry as setting an extremely high standard of professional knowledge.     Before being allowed to enroll for the two-year program, potential candidates must persuade the Institute that they have the necessary aptitude by submitting an essay and tasting notes. In addition, they must be interviewed by, and obtain the mentoring of, an existing Master of Wine.     Candidates must sit both the theory (four papers) and practical (three blind tastings) parts of the examination in the same year. If they achieve success in only one part, however, they may attempt the remaining part in the subsequent two years. If successful at the examination stage, candidates must then write and submit a dissertation within six months of approval of a synopsis by the Institute's Education and Examination Board.     The Institute states that over the seven year period up to 2000, of the 266 candidates who undertook the programme a total of 85 were successful in passing all parts of the examination and becoming Masters of Wine.","FoodDrink"

"How to select garden tools?","Here are the basic garden tools:    1. A spading fork is your first tool. Before you plant anything, you will need to open and improve the soil. A spading fork looks like a pitchfork but has a shorter handle and wider tines. It is used to dig down into hard soil and break up the ground.     2. Next, choose a hoe. A hoe is useful for weeding and cultivating the surface of the soil to allow for penetration of nutrients and water.     3. You'll need a watering can. Long nozzles allow the water to come out at a very gentle flow rate and are useful for reaching across long distances. Select a watering can that has a detachable spray head - this type of watering can is perfect for watering young seedlings.     4. Choose a round-ended shovel for larger digging projects, such as planting shrubs and trees.     5. You'll need a good bow rake, which has short tines on one side attached to a metal frame or 'bow.' It's used for leveling the soil after it has been turned and prior to planting, or for removing large clods of earth or rocks from the soil. You can also turn a bow rake over and use the flat side to smooth soil in preparation for planting.     6. Select a pair of garden shears that fits comfortably in your hand. Shears, sometimes called clippers, are used for pruning, shaping and removing foliage or branches. Don't buy the most expensive shears until you decide you like gardening.","HomeGarden"

"How and why do you decant a wine?","You decant a wine to separate clear wine from sediment, to mix oxygen in to an ageworthy wine that is being opened while immature, and for aesthetics.    When you do decant a wine, the method differs depending on your purpose.     If you're decanting to avoid sediment, you must pour the wine gently from the bottle to the decanter, making sure not to shake the bottle or pick it up and put it down repeatedly. This way, the sediment will stay at the bottom of the bottle and not mix into the wine.     If you're decanting to breathe an immature wine, you should pour vigorously, with the idea of splashing as much air as possible into the wine.","FoodDrink"

"Does anyone have a recipe for baba ganoush?","Baba Ghannouj - Eggplant Dip    1 large round eggplant     2 or 3 cloves of garlic     4 Tbs. tahini (Sesame Paste)    3-4 Tbs. fresh lemon juice     ½ - 1 tsp. salt (to taste)         Garnish    red pepper, chopped parsley, sumac (red-brown spice that has a lemony flavor),Olive oil, toasted ground cumin (optional)         Preparation:    Wash the eggplant and prick with a fork in 5 spots. You need to cook the eggplant and get it really soft. I find that the most flavorful way is to place the whole eggplant directly over the flame of a gas burner on the stove and blacken one side of the eggplant. But if I do the entire eggplant this way it is too smoky flavored. So I blacken ½ and then I wrap it in foil and bake it on high heat in an oven until it very soft.     (If you like really smoky baba ghannouj – you can cook the entire eggplant on the stove top over a burner turning it with tongs as blackened until cooked through and very soft)         When it is well cooked through, let cool (can douse with cold water), peel the skin off the eggplant (sometimes it is so soft that you actually cut in half and scoop the eggplant away from the skin. Chop into small pieces. Mash two or three cloves of garlic to a paste with about the same volume of salt. Add to eggplant, Blend the tahini with the lemon juice and stir into the eggplant. Adjust seasoning.      If using a food processor put cooked eggplant, minced garlic, salt, tahini, lemon juice, and olive oil into bowl and puree to desired texture. Adjust seasoning.      Tips    If mixture seems too thick, add a little cream or half & half.    A pinch of red cayenne makes the flavors blend better.

"Is siu mai considered a dumpling? What's the difference between dumplings and potstickers?","Dim sum, a Cantonese term, is usually a light weekend meal or brunch with family and friends. It literally means, order heart, or order to one's heart's content, according to Wikipedia. Dim sum dishes can be ordered from a menu, but at most restaurants the food is wheeled around on carts by servers. The usual choices include steamed buns, dumplings, and rice rolls, but there are always the delectable favorites like chicken feet, tripe, and congee (rice porridge). And don't forget the unlimited tea service!  As for the difference between dumplings and potstickers, potstickers are a form of Chinese dumplings called jiaozi, consisting of meat and mixed vegetables, wrapped into a piece of thin dough. Commonly used fillings are shrimp, beef, pork, or lamb. When jiaozi are fried, that's when they're called potstickers. Another kind of Chinese dumpling are the baozi, which are formed with a thick leavened bun (compared to the thin, noodle-like skin of the jiaozi).  The Wikipedia page on dumplings simply states, There are other kinds of dumplings such as ...Siew Mai... which I found to be a variant spelling of Siu Mai, Siu Mye, and Shu Mai dumplings. These are steamed pork dumplings (though I found some random recipes for chicken siu mai, etc.), and from recipezaar.com, the chef recommends these from a tasting of thirteen other dumplings!

Paint your wall trim and moldings a lighter color than your walls. When you paint your moldings light, the wall appears further back, making your living room appear bigger.    Furniture arrangement can make your living room look bigger. Put your larger furniture pieces at a diagonal. This works because the longest straight line in any given room is it's diagonal. When you place your furniture at an angle, it leads the eye along the longer distance, rather than the shorter wall.     Don't cove your walls with a lot of pictures.

"Refried, black and pinto beans, what are the differences?","Mmm, delicious whichever you choose. But to be specific, black beans (also known as turtle beans) are pea-sized, jet-black oval beans with an earthy, almost smoky flavor and a soft, mealy texture. Pintos are medium-sized long painted beans, with reddish tan skins usually mottled with brown flecks. Though purists might insist upon pintos, these days refried beans of both varieties are available at taquerias and grocery markets (with the other canned foods). Refried beans aren't really fried twice so much as fried well. To refry, add the beans of your choosing to a hot, heavy pan (cast irons recommended) that's been coated in oil (or, if you're going to be traditional, lard) and finely chopped onion and garlic. Mash away with your masher or fork, adding salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer your beans completely creamy, mash until smooth. If not, set aside a cupful and add to the smashed mixture, then reheat.

What does it mean?","Here's a good answer to your question that I found in mainbrace website:    After grapes are picked in the vineyard, they are crushed, then fermented and aged, and then bottled. During fermentation, yeasts turn much of the sugar in the crushed grapes to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Between the fermentation stage and aging, many winemakers subject the wine to another step: malolactic fermentation.     During this step the malic acid present in the wine is converted to lactic acid. This has the effect of reducing the sharpness of the wine and introducing a smooth, sometimes even buttery flavour. (Lactic acid is the acid present in milk and milk products.)    Why do winemakers do this? Although the process has been known for some time, it is only within the last twenty years or so that the demand for easy-drinking, approachable wines has led wineries to strive for smoother wines that can be consumed with comfort without long aging to mellow out their flavours.","FoodDrink"

"i've been using tags in products such as delicious, my web 2.0, and flickr...but how do i explain the significance of tagging to somebody like my mom? what does it all mean?","Tags are like post-it notes that readers of the content leave behind for other readers. They give clues to the context and meaning beyond a simple description. They're like finding notes in a text book scribbled by a previous owner. You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes. Now imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular post-its thanks to an index of all of them. This is where the real power of tagging lies-- in the weight and meaning these agreed-upon notes give. Of course, context is everything. Next time you're together, show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent, most popular, most frequently used tags.

I typically take 1 part polenta (corn meal) and 3 parts water and put it in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. About halfway through you should stir it. It will be soft and creamy. Step 2: When the polenta is done, you add chopped sundried tomatoes and some Chipotle sause (I get mine at Trader Joes). The more chipotle the spicier the dish will be. You can eat it right away, or let it sit for a while to cool off and harden. Step 3 (optional) Once it is hard, you can cut it in slices, and quickly brown them under the broiler right before serving.","FoodDrink"

"which one is better ? BMW or infinity G35?","When comparing these two makes it’s important to establish which two models and trim levels would be comparable. For this example I will use the Infiniti G35 Manual and the BMW 330xi (both 2006). First off is the pricing, where Infiniti beats the BMW in any configuration (eg, add-ons etc). From a drivers perspective the engine inside of the Infiniti is a very reliable and steady powerhouse with a slightly lower torque band than the BMW. Then again after driving both cars and driving BMW's for years I have to say now that I favor the BMW Inline 6 which is a pinnacle of automotive engineering. Its been retooled over the years but the engine is one of the most perfect machines that I have ever driven with gear ratios and compression that feel just right. The Infiniti manual tranny can’t really be compared to a BMW, who has honed their 6 speed to a silky smooth or dynamic box. Its true that what you put in is what you get out in a BMW, because you can drive them hard or soft and the overall dynamic I wouldn’t trade for an Infiniti, which has a noticeable difference in feel... its heavier but still a very capable machine. If you are auto sticking I still prefer the BMW Steptronic 6. In terms of comfort the 3 series has made a consistent effort to provide a very organic support to the drivers and passengers with the addition of the premium and sports packages. The Infiniti does have larger and more a more plush feel as well as a much more comprehensible navigation system. The inclusion of the rather complex iDrive system in BMW's has frustrated a lot of drivers including myself (although once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense, just very frustrating to start). The iPod integration in BMW's is still rather sketchy... you cant have that and certain components installed at the same time and ealier versions limited how many playlists and songs the stero system could actually recognize and play. Later versions are somewhat improved but the aftermarket additions by Alpine can be worth it if you are an avid user. In terms of over all feel the Infiniti has made more inroads this year in terms of creature comforts than BMW. I would suggest the addition of the premium package for improved audio quality in both vehicles. Already a nimble machine the addition of the Sport package for the BMW makes it a very satisfying experience for the driving enthusiast. I trust the xDrive system to provide more sure footing in all weather but I haven’t had a chance to test the Infiniti in other than optimal conditions. The Infiniti is a very nice machine overall. Good dynamics and characteristics make it the best bang for the buck but personally I would suggest to splurge and go for the BMW, which, besides its wonderful performance and better care package provided in the Ownership benefits (BMW Maintenance Program), has better standing than the Infiniti.","CarsTransportation"

"After posting a question and immediately seeing it at the top of the Yahoo Q&A home page, I was struck by how vunerable this system seems to spam? I like seeing the newest questions appear up top, but it seems like we are providing an easy and eventually high-profile way for spammers to spam. Should only questions from users with high points appear on the front page? Should a visibility score be kept behind the scenes so that user can only have as much visibility as they have points (and their visibility score goes up by 25 points when their questions appear on the top page)? Are there other spam problems that Q&A might have that would be different from blog comments? If we end up using points to assign trust, how do we keep users from using bots to inflate their trust? How do we prevent the equivalent of a link network where two bots might post and answer each other's questions instantaneously to get lots of points?

"I currently have Xbox and PS2. I don't think I can justify getting both Xbox 360 and PS3 due to the prices and limited budget. Which one should I choose?","This is a highly opinionated question, and it really depends on what you like. However, I personally would say if you're only going to get one, get the PS3. I've never owned an Xbox, for multiple reasons, one being there's only a small selection of games I'd be interested in gettting, whereas for PS2 I have 43 games (including PSone games). I'm expecting some great games to come out for PS3, wereas for Xbox360 I'd be surprised if there's more than a handful of games that I'd want. But again, this is all just personal preference. You may decide you prefer the Xbox games. It depends on what games you like, what genres (if you enjoy RPGs then PS3 is what you want - PS2 has been the platform of choice for RPGs so far, and I would be surprised if the PS3 didn't continue this trend). Now, given all this, you also need to think about the Nintendo Revolution. It's going to come out later than the PS3, so you'll have more time to save up some money, and it's definitely going to be the cheapest console of the three. And with its unique control scheme (if you don't know about it, you can probably find the original article on ign.com) it's not so much a competitor for the other two consoles as a companion. Anyway, if you can afford it, I highly recommend getting the Revolution in addition to whichever other console you decide upon. Addition: Turns out the Xbox 360 is also pretty horribly bug-ridden. You might want to give it a pass.","GamesRecreation"

"What are the effects of parental favoritism?","From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects.     My mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. 50 years later, she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. Because of this, she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.    My grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. My grandmother was treated as the most special. Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. My grandmother grew up needing others to take care of her.    This is a pattern I've seen. Those that are favored end up developing few of their skills and talents. Many times they grow up becoming more concerned about pleasing other people. And many times they don't know how to take care of themselves.    Those that are disfavored can become strongly independent, but they may also have weaknesses in their ability to trust others and form lasting relationships. What is true is that favoritism has an unhealthy emotional impact on all children, whether favored or not.

"So, what will be the distance from the sun that makes it reasonable to look for life?","You might not have intended it, but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought. It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are, with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins. To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins. This fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two. Now for the second part of your question: The light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun. The heat is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition. There are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a temperature around 1000k.","ScienceMathematics"

Pursuers only pursue when they feel they have the advantage, being stronger or bigger so the most effective dissuader was to indicate their size as being much larger, than the pursuing hunter cared to could deal with. This was how the trampling down of a large area for their bed began. (The pursuing tracker was to be itimidated by themassive size of a dog's bedding down imprint.) This ploy was so successful at enabling dogs to evade their enemies, thatdogs healthfully survive and most foes of dogs have abandoned their pursuit, however dogs still circle before resting.","Pets"

You might want to check the waiver and see if somebody like McMahon - the new Philly QB is available as he's got a nice matchup this week and could be better than your two current options.","Sports"

"They both stop itching, but when do I use one over the other?","They are actually both antihistimines (although Benadryl does come in a topical formula). Allegra requires a prescription, Benadryl does not. Allegra has a formulation that lasts 24 hours (the 180mg version); their other formulation (the 60mg version) lasts 12 hours. I believe Benadryl allergy is a 50mg version (so you need to take a more doses per day for the same length relief). The active ingredient in each is different as well: Allegra 180mg (the 24 hour extended version) has two active ingredients (fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); regular Allegra's active ingredient is fexofenadine hydrochloride, and Benadryl's active ingredient is Diphenhydramine. If both work equally well for you, it's probably more economical for you to go with the prescription (if you have health insurance) - the co-pay will be less for a 30 day supply than it would cost for 30 days worth of Over The Counter Benadryl.","Health"
"Why was the Passion of Christ a controversial movie?","Jewish people were concerned that the movie would fuel antisemitism. A concerned Rabbi Eugene Korn previewed the film before it came out and made the following statement, We are deeply concerned that the film, if released in its present form, will fuel the hatred, bigotry and anti-Semitism that many responsible churches have worked hard to repudiate. Another controversial aspect of the movie was its graphically violent depiction of Jesus' crucifixation. Some Christians were upset that the movie choose to focus on Jesus' violent death rather than other Biblical themes like the resurrection and his life experiences valuing messages of love, tolerance, and redemption.","EntertainmentMusic"

"I'm new to road biking and need a bike under $1000. What frame and parts do you recommend?","I'd agree with TaraN's answer. Take the time to really find what you want. Take a lot of extended test rides. You might find that aluminum might be too harsh for you, in which case you might find that steel or carbon might be more comfortable. That's just one example. Lots of test rides will give you a feel for how the various bikes at a given price point can handle very differently. Without getting into too much tech-speak, you might find that one bike handles a bit more twitchy than another. Think of the difference as driving a Mini Cooper versus a basic sedan. Some bikes are set up more for racing, where you'll get a quicker handling bike, whereas others will handle a bit more laid back. Parts wise, you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point, as TaraN pointed out. You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets, with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example, Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry). Focus on the overall ride of the bike. For a $1000, you can get a lot of bike. Wade at The Spokesman in downtown Santa Cruz is a GREAT guy - very helpful, and yes, very patient. He's very knowledgeable and will set you up right. Also in that same category, I'd highly recommend seeing Vance Sprock over at Cupertino Bike Shop. He's just like Wade - he'll set you up right.

"Every year sportswriters and fans complain about how unfair the BCS is, so what's preventing the various conferences from a playoff system?","- The bowls came first and have to be dislodged - The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money. Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters. - Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year. Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing. Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery. This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). A playoff system would require the two teams meeting for the championship to play and additional 2-4 games depending on the number of teams allowed to participate in the playoffs.","Sports"

"how hot does turkey stuffing have to be?","The turkey breast should register 180 degrees and the stuffing should be 165. But the key to getting the stuffing hot enough without overcooking the turkey is to pack the stuffing carefully. Fill the inside of the bird with stuffing, but don't press it in. If you would like additional stuffing, roast it in a separate roasting pan with chicken stock for added flavor. The best tasting stuffing will be inside the turkey, but this way you can be sure there will be enough to go around and no one will get sick! If stuffing a turkey, use a meat thermometer. If stuffing does not reach 165 °F when the turkey itself is done to 180 °F, further cooking will be required. During the added cooking necessary to bring the stuffing up to a safe temperature, the meat may become overcooked.","FoodDrink"

"What kind of guitar is Joaquin Phoenix playing in the Germany scenes in Walk the Line? You can see the one I mean at about 30 seconds and 50 seconds (the hangar and the music store) in the trailer on Yahoo! Movies. It doesn't appear to have a standard sound hole, just two curved openings on either side of the strings. It's almost like an archtop, but I can't believe it's an electric; that seems out of character and you never see him with an amp. Bonus points, where can I buy one?","Can't answer your question exactly, but it looks an awful lot like a Gibson archtop or a Gretsch. You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture. There are particular models of Gibson & Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a chromatic tailpiece. I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape. The one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious soapbar pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then).","EntertainmentMusic"

"Or is it mostly for styling?","On the bug, the spoiler really serves two purposes: 1) Visually differentiates the turbo model in a low key way 2) By disrupting laminar flow over the roof of the car, reduces the lift (rather than increasing downforce) generated by bernoulli's principle. It also keeps water off the rear window. Joey is right in his assessment of most spoilers. You have to have a pretty big one to have any effect. My Evo's spoiler is a good example of a functional piece (it is homologated as a racing aero part). It's about a foot tall and has a flat airfoil. Even with a wing that size you don't really see an effect until around 60-70 mph, which is useful on a track but not really on the street. I make my spoiler useful by driving it on a track ;). Useful aero pieces on production cars usually take two forms, either a tiny lip on the trailing edge of a car (reduces drag and lift), or a giant wing (which should be flat, curved wings are not as effective), which increases downforce but also increases drag. The Beetle's spoiler is really more of a lip than a spoiler.","CarsTransportation"

They are pricey, but considering how much time I spend listening to music in my cube, they are one of the best purchases I've made. The sound is really great and the base is very deep, though it does have a signature Bosey sound to it since it has to employ acoustic tricks to replicate low-frequencies at high volumes. No one around you will hear a think when you listen to them. You will still hear people talking around you, but they do remove ambient pretty well. The Bose Triports are very similar though without noise-cancellation. Good base and blocks a lot of noise. Best sound-quality I've heard for $150. The Shure e2c go in your ear and block out almost all sound. The sound quality is pretty great for ear buds (they have many similar more expensive versions), but they can be tiring on your ears and get cruddy after a while.

Also, are there particular kits/pads that are preferable?","The Roland V-drums and their special mesh heads have got the best feel of the electronic drumkits available, but they are also pretty expensive. An electronic drumkit in general is an expensive proposition for a beginner, because you need to buy all the hardware (drum pads, rack, sound module, speakers), and the low-end kits will run you about $800. -- You might be able to get them for a bit less on ebay.

Also these were useful to ensure that a shipment of commodities arrived with the same goods that were shipped Paper money was used in the 18th century, but only in the late 18th and through the 19th century was a central monetary authority created in various states that had a virtual monopoly of creating bank-notes that had to be accepted as legal tender everywhere (Prior to this, the one accepting payments could refuse the payment if it was not in a currency which had been predetermined before the loan or in general use: Note gold and silver were widely used as legal tender)","SocietyCulture"

"what are the differences between the those beams?","Materials that form an inverse energy distribution? Not quite. There are three basic components for getting a laser to work. First, one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp, an electrical spark, etc. Second, one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states. Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others. Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator. There are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use. There are solid state (ruby, Nd:YAG), gas (nitrogen, helium-neon) and semiconductor (gallium-arsenide) lasers that come in a variety of wavelengths (colors) to choose from, again, depending on what you want to do with it.

"what supports this theory?","The answer to your question is no. There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date. We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice. There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place. Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago. Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there. The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there. Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars. Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil. Given our current rate of deepening understanding, we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years, but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute proof","ScienceMathematics"

"If I choose to open an email attachment, will it be saved on my hard drive too?","Probably, but it can vary depending on which e-mail software you're using. Most of the time, desktop e-mail clients (as opposed to web mail services like Yahoo! Mail) will download the entire message -- including attachments -- to your hard drive before you ever see it. Then if you delete the message, it (usually) goes away. If you choose to open the attachment, you're often given a choice of whether to save it or just open it -- but even just opening it means it's been saved somewhere, usually a temporary cache. Sometimes, though, those temporary caches stick around for a long time. With web mail services, you do have to download the attachment before viewing it -- though in that case, your browser will probably put it in the same kind of temporary cache unless you choose to save it somewhere.","ComputersInternet"

"What is programming?","Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. The role of a programming language can be described in two ways: 1. Technical: It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks 2. Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. According to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things: * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. According to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,]) ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this: primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units.'' A programming lanugage should both provide means to describe primitive data and procedures and means to combine and abstract those into more complex ones. The distinction between data and procedures is not that clear cut. In many programming languages, procedures can be passed as data (to be applied to ``real'' data) and sometimes processed like ``ordinary'' data. Conversely ``ordinary'' data can be turned into procedures by an evaluation mechanism.","ComputersInternet"

"Please, none of those it's beyond our understanding answers. I want some real answers here!","Frankly, the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible. Assuming that – as a Christian – you buy into Job’s tale as at least allegorical, then there is acknowledgement that you cannot know the mind of G-d. To attempt to do so is itself blasphemous. To attempt know the mind of G-d is to be G-d, yet we are admonished when G-d responds to Job, not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when G-d created the world? And it was said: Job 40 1 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job and said: 2 Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God, let him answer it. 3 Then Job answered Jehovah and said: 4 Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will put my hand to my mouth. 5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further. 6 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said: 7 Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you make Me to know. 8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified? 9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His? 10 Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor; 11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low; 12 look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place; 13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness. Know that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him. A previous answer blasphemed: “G-d desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.? And also: “But there is a plan to alleviate the suffering. And that is through redemption.? Lies. And “John 3:16??! I think that means “go Broncos.? An alternative explanation is the easy one: there is no G-d. You either believe that, or you blaspheme in the attempt to understand Him.","SocietyCulture"

However, if you are looking at most state univerisities, then a low SAT/ACT score is not too bad. You may have to take a few remedial courses. MOST IMPORTANT!! A low SAT/ACT score WILL NOT stop you from going to college.

"Appeal to their ego? wallets? sense of belonging? or something else?","I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn incentivizes people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased. See my answer to the question, Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767 On the issue of the term incentivize--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process.

The exception in my mind is that if you are trying to make some decisions/choices while interviewing for multiple positions then you can candidly bring it up after your first interview is done.","BusinessFinance"
"Why does my BMW take only premium gasoline?","BMW engines are designed to run at a high compression ratio. If you took chemistry in high school, you remember the ideal gas rule PV=nRT which essentially states that with increased pressure you get increased temperatures. So the cylinders in a bmw run hot. Premium gas ignites at a higher temperature, so it is compatible with the engine in your car.     Regular gas has the same amount of energy but will catch on fire prematurely in your cylinders causing knocking and pinging which is bad for your engine. If you put regular gas your car, it is smart enough to catch it but you will have less power. Also a tiny amount of damage can potentially happen each time you do this as the car will assume it's premium then dial back in response to the pinging. So I wouldn't do it for any extended period of time.    It is important to know that cars designed to run on regular gas do not benefit AT ALL from using premium, so don't bother.","CarsTransportation"

"I need to get a wireless card for my laptop. Are all cards compatible with all laptops? Which one is best?","Q: Are all cards compatible? A: Not quite. If your laptop is a Mac Powerbook or iBook, you should get a USB wireless network adapter. And regardless if it's a Windows or Mac laptop, it's a good idea to double-check that it doesn't already have wireless capability built-in (most do nowadays). Assuming your laptop runs Windows, doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter, and is a relatively recent model (a Pentium II or newer CPU is a good hint), then just about any wireless card will work and you skip the rest of this explanation. If your laptop is more than 7 or 8 years old, you need to make sure it supports CardBus PCMCIA cards. Many wireless PCMCIA cards use the CardBus interface - it provides higher performance than the standard PCMCIA interface. Unfortunately, CardBus slots look just like a regular PCMCIA slot, so you can't tell if your laptop supports them just by looking. You can, however, easily tell if a wireless PCMCIA card uses CardBus or not. If it has a gold strip on top the end that goes into the PCMCIA slot, then it's a CardBus PCMCIA card. Many manufacturers of wireless PCMCIA cards offer them using both interfaces. Here's an example of a Siemens card (along with pictures that clearly show the difference between a regular PCMCIA card and CardBus card): http://kb.efficient.com/display/1n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=45947&r=0.1037256 Q: Which one is best? A: It depends on what your wireless network supports. But, in general, there are several good options and at very reasonable prices. WARNING: If you want to buy a wireless card to use at work though, you MUST check with your IT department before buying anything. First, they should really provide a wireless card - you shouldn't have to buy one. Second, businesses often configure their wireless networks to use specific security features, and you want to make sure you buy equipment that will be compatible. OK, assuming you want to use this for wireless connectivity at home, then just about any wireless card that supports 802.11g (aka Wireless-G) will suffice. I say that because most equipment for wireless home networks sold today uses the 802.11g standard. And anything that you buy nowadays will provide more than adequate security and encryption options. Choice of brand matters a lot, though I can't recommend a single one because you really want to get the same brand as the rest of your wireless networking equipment. For instance, if you have a Linksys wireless router at home, then get a Linksys wireless card. Technically, most of the wireless equipment is compatible with each other (I won't get into the gory details of why that's not always true), but if you get equipment from the same brand, then you know it's been tested by the manufacturer to be compatible. And the software you use to setup the various pieces of equipment will be very similar and use the same descriptions for various options - that should make things less confusing. If you're buying the other networking equipment too (e.g. the wireless router), then I recommend Linksys. I've never been disappointed by their products - good performance, reliability, support and at very good prices to boot. And you can find their products in almost any major retail store that carries computer products (like Best Buy). Hope this helps!","ComputersInternet"

The stakeholders of an organization could be its shareholders, employees, vendors, customers, communities where it operates etc. I have seen this term more and more used in the context of sustainable development: what matters is not just the wealth of the shareholders, owning money is now only one of several goals that also include having positive environmental and social impacts.

Any other manufacturers you recommend and what specifications should I look for?","I would wait for HD video, mainly because there are a number of issues with it. It's such a new technology that HD camcorders will halve in price in a relatively short time. Also, with HD video, unless you have a computer hooked up to your HD display, you have no way of editing and then outputing HD video to an HD capable set, so either you're watching raw footage or you're using a computer to watch your video. Once HD consumer DVD devices come out, there will be cheaper solutions for both recording, editing, and outputing HD video, and this should all happen fairly quickly, in a year or so. If you want fantastic quality and have $2000 to spend a used Canon GL2 will offer much better video quality than any HD consumer camcorder, despite the lower resolution. Otherwise, I would wait.","ConsumerElectronics"

No white smoke from the tailpipe.","I think that may be a sign of a blown headgasket. I think if that might be the case the best thing to try is to check the oil to see if any coolant has gotten into it(I think its a brownish milky color if it has), and also maybe check the coolant to see if any oil has gotten into it. Other things you might check are. check under the car to see if coolant is leaking somewhere. It might just be a leak, check the hoses to see if they are wet. changing a hose is quite a bit cheaper than changing a headgasket. those are some things that are easy to do before going under the gun to replacing the headgasket.","CarsTransportation"

As a result, the shifter is just a switch and can take any form that the designers choose to implement.

"How do I protect myself from credit card scam?","If you dont want to pay for the services such as bank of america here are a couple of things you can do to reduce your chances of your identity being stolen 1. shred all your mail 2. By law, you can request 1 copy of your credit history every year from each of the three credit history companies at www.annualcreditreport.com I suggest you stagger your requests to each of them i.e. request experian first then 4 months later request another report from transunion, and another 4 months later from equifax. this way you get a free report every 4 months. 3. dispute anything that is wrong (most common: credit cards forget to tell the credit history guys that you closed your account or paid all your loans in full) 4. when online, try to use virtual credit numbers to make the purchases. this facility is available for citicard customers, and maybe amex. the virtual numbers are good only for 1 use, and useless after that. so if someone steals that, it is useless. 5. when buying something offline, save your receipts, and make sure your statement is accurate. (a favourite scam is to charge maybe 50cents on a statement, that way you dont notice it, but a scammer who charges 10,000 card owners 50cents a month can make $5000 a month no sweat -- and you dont even realize it) 6. also dont forget to shread any credit card solicitations you dont plan to use.","BusinessFinance"

"What will the gun ban in the city accomplish? Will crime rate in San Francisco drop?","The gun ban meassure makes it illegal to posses or sell firearms and ammunition anywhere in the city of San Francisco. The National Rifle Association has sued to overturn this ban. When a similar ban passed in 1982, the NRA sued and succesfully overturned the ban.    As for crime rate, it is hard to predict. A common argument made by right wing gun supporters says, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will sell guns. And Michael Moore, a prominent left wing activist and film maker, concluded in his film Bowling for Columbine that it is not necessarily the guns that make American culture violent (he points to how Canadians have even greater access to firearms, yet their crime rate is significantly lower).     Anti-gun arguments include: *Citizens have no need to own guns to protect themselves against crime because government is tasked with that obligation. *Guns, being devices implicitly designed to kill, raise the level of violence in any disagreement between people. *Guns are more dangerous to the owners than to intended targets because most gun related deaths are a result of domestic violence, accidents, and suicides.    According to the third link below, when D.C. banned firearms in 1976, the murder rate increased:    Crime has risen significantly since the gun ban went into effect. In the five years before Washington's ban in 1976, the murder rate fell from 37 to 27 per 100,000. In the five years after it went into effect, the murder rate rose back up to 35. In fact, the murder rate after 1976 has never fallen back to what it was in 1976. Robberies and overall violent crime changed just as dramatically.    But obviously in the real world there are many variables that affect the crime rate. So it is hard to truly measure what kind of impact a gun ban has on crime rate since you cannot isolate it from all of the other variables.","NewsEvents"

"What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree?","One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE. In addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. In contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.","EducationReference"
"What's the difference between a divorce and an anullment?","Taken from divorcenet.com: A divorce is the legal separation and termination of the marital relationship by the judgment of a court which may be granted only upon a finding by the court that certain grounds for divorce exist. A divorce puts an end to the marital relationship. An annulment is a decree from a court determining that the marriage is legally invalid because of some defect that existed at the time the marriage was entered into. An annulment decree declares that a marital status never existed, unlike a divorce decree that terminates a marriage. The grounds for an annulment include: an underage marriage; bigamy (i.e. one of the parties has another living spouse); mental incompetence of one of the parties; fraud; duress and nonconsummation of the marriage (which may include impotency).","FamilyRelationships"
"I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT DSLR. I already have a Canon EF 17-40L lens which takes great shots, but need a zoom. what should i get?","It depends on what you shoot. For wild life a long telephoto zoom like the 100-400L IS is very convenient. Note that this is a f/5.6 lens (at 400) so is not particularly fast but it is very sharp and the range is very convenient. I've rented this lens a few times and I've always been happy with the results. If you prefer a fast lens the 70-200/2.8 IS is probably the best zoom made by Canon. Very sharp, fast, well made and favored by professionals. Those two lenses are expensive and heavy. If you prefer something lighter: The 70-300 DO IS (strictly speaking not an L lens but close enough) is very light and convenient, especially for travel. Not cheap though. And finally the 70-200/4L is cheap, is not nearly as heavy as the 2.8 lenses, and takes great photos. It doesn't have image stabilization so you'll need to use faster shutter speeds than with the previous lenses, or use a tripod. I personally own the 70-200/2.8L IS and a 75-300/4.0-5.6 III lens. The 75-300 is nowhere near the quality of any of the previous lenses, but it is very light and easy to carry.","ConsumerElectronics"

"How many miles should I go before I need to get the oil changed?","Since you drive a BMW, the car will tell you when to change the oil. Oil life is determined by a variety of factors including highway vs city mileage, temperature, average rpm, load factor, etc. The every 5000K miles recommendation from most car companies is a calculated guess but BMW's have a system that take these factors into account. So basically when the car tells you to do it, you should do it. You can even do it yourself, it only takes about 20 minutes of your time once you learn.","CarsTransportation"

"What is the world's smallest digital camera which still produces high quality pictures?","Quality is such a subjective question. In order to get small size and maintain image quality, you need one key feature: autofocus. Of course, it's a compromise. The smallest digital camera that takes decent pictures (much better than most camera phones, for instance) is the Sony DSC-U40. It's 2 megapixels and has an autofocus lens. It has no zoom, but that's sort of necessary given the size. It's 3.3 x 1.5 x 1 in. If you want a zoom I'd recommend the Canon PowerShot SD30. By using a molded glass aspherical lens, they've made an incredibly compact 5 MP digital camera with a 2.6X zoom. It's only slightly larger and takes significantly better pictures. Size is 3.8 x 1.8 x .9 inches. See the attached link for a sample pic from the camera.","ConsumerElectronics"

"With the USA having been the 4th country I have lived in, I am curious as to why the media/government wants to keep the general populous so inwardly focused. You find very little mention of things/events around the rest of the world in the main-stream media here. What's your take on this issue?","A large part of the America-centric focus of the American media is as a result of its structure. Let me explain: the American media is more privatized than any other media system in the world. Take the BBC, for example, it is a government-sponsored media outlet (rather than commercially sponsored) and it was conceived as a tool to educate the public. The American media -- first print, then radio, then television -- evolved as a system that is primarily supported by the money advertisers pay broadcasters for ad space. Advertisers are interested in at least two things: 1) the largest audience share (they race to capture the median viewer); and 2) a lack of controversy out of fear that their brand image might suffer in the mind of the public. This is part of the reason why the media pick domestic topics and focus on high-profile domestic personages (less controversy, and more relevant to the daily lives of Americans, so thus, more watched). Another reason has to do with the news cycle of the American media. In many countries, the news is still a half-hour, hour, or couple hours per day. In the U.S. with cable news, the news cycle is now 24-hours. This constant pressure to always be turning out stories gives journalists incentives to make their story production as efficient as possible. In practice, this means developing a set of official contacts that they can rely upon for sound bites that relate to their reporting areas. They build trust with these contacts and can count upon them to respond quickly. With major news bureaus tending to be on the east coast of the U.S., it is easier for journalists to develop ongoing relationships with officials who don't live at great geographic distances (even with the Internet, I'd argue). Also, with the rise in prominence of public relations firm (firms that specialize in creating news-worthy promotional material that frames their organizational or individual clients in a favorable light), information about celebrities and American personages is readily available and pre-processed for journalists to be newsworthy, and thus, such material is exceptionally appealing to journalists who by and large are ALL on a very tight deadline. Some communications researchers in the past have argued that -- with the exception of the elite -- most everyone in all countries would be interested in more gossip, lifestyle, and entertainment news. What stops some countries from providing it is either an authoritarian regime, or perhaps the more benevolent goal of providing an educational service. If you're really interested in this topic, I suggest a couple of interesting books: *The Creation of the Media* by Paul Starr, and *Deciding What's News* by Herbert J. Gans, both of whom are scholars of great repute.","NewsEvents"

If you need to cut up into chunks for sauteeing or something, do this: 1. Cut lengthwise, and then into quarters. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise again if very large (should look like watermelon slices). 2. Take sharp knife parallel to cutting surface and place right between skin and flesh. 3. Run knife along the bottom and remove flesh from the skin. Place hand on top of squash flesh to keep pressure on. 4. cut up into cubes or whatever shape. And remember it should feel more like running the squash along the knife, than moving a knife through the squash. Small difference, but results in fewer cuts.","FoodDrink"

Folksonomies are often implemented using tags. An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in.","ComputersInternet"

Judy In Disguise (With Glasses) - John Fred & His Playboy Band 3. (Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay - Otis Redding 4. People Got To Be Free - The Rascals 5. Chain Of Fools - Aretha Franklin 6. Green Tambourine - The Lemon Pipers 7. Cry Like A Baby - The Box Tops 8. Mony Mony - Tommy James & The Shondells 9. Yummy Yummy Yummy - Ohio Express 10. The Horse - Cliff Nobles & Co. ONE of those songs was #1 on July 7, 1968. and on the This Day in Music History site (resourced below), there are matches for top singles for July 7th, but not for the year 1968. and Finally, on July 7, 1968, Led Zeppelin was officially founded by Jimmy Page. And THAT, is worth a mention. My guess is that the #1 song on Billboard's chart for July 7, 1968 was already on the charts for several days or weeks.

One other way I keep my skin clear is by making sure I hydrate - I drink boatloads of water (my aesthetician always comments on this when I go in for facials).

"which is the largest lake in the United States?","I'll assume that when you write largest that you are referring to the surface area of the lake. Superior is the largest lake that's partly in the United States at 31,820 square miles. The largest lake entirely contained in the United States is Lake Michigan, 22,400 square miles. Excluding the great lakes, the Great Salt Lake in Utah is the largest lake in the USA at 1700 square miles. There is a little bit of controversy, as some believe that Lake Michigan and Luke Huron are really one lake at 45,410 square miles. So, depending on who you ask, the answer could be the bi-national Lake Michigan/ Lake Huron, the bi-national Lake Superior, the possibly-only-half-a-lake Lake Michigan or the Great Salt Lake. You could even take it a step further-- if you consider Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to be one lake, you only want to consider lakes entirely within the United States, and you want to restrict it to fresh water lakes, you'd have to look further. Lake Iliamna is the next in line at 1000 square miles. But it's in Alaska, so if you restrict yourself to the 48 contiguous states, you need to cast a wider net still. Lake Okeechobee is next at 700 square miles-- but it's really more of a swamp. So you may want to look even further to Lake Champlain at 490 square miles. So take your pick-- Michigan/Huron, Superior, Michigan, Great Salt, Iliamna, Okeechobee or Champlain!","Travel"
"Are Wireless Networks Secure?","Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or snoop the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or inject unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough? Wireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots. Network engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment. Overall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now secure enough to use in the vast majority of homes, and many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or encrypt network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients. Obviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!","ComputersInternet"

"What makes a teacher want to leave their profession?","It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship. According to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. (Huling-Austin, 1986). These are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers: 1) Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline, difficulties with parents, and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials. 2) Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments. 3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching. Other factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies.","EducationReference"

"How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts?","Where do you live? I have been taking a class called Core Fusion for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt). It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006. If you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?). So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring). There are also the old standbys of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat). One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries. If you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines.","Health"

Back in the late 80's/early 90's you could get clamp-on cantilever brake mounts from Moots, but I don't know that they make those anymore. And regardless, if you were to do that, you'd also be dropping the overall height of your bike. This in turn would mean that your bottom bracket would also be lower to the ground. That's counterproductive in terms of cyclocross applications, where you want a higher bottom bracket than you would on a road bike (for clearence issues).

However, not saying excuse me when you sneeze - or shortly thereafter - is inexcusable. I grew up in a country where saying bless you is optional for the sneezee, but excuse me is mandatory for the sneezer. Not so in the USA, in my experience. I've never heard an American say excuse me after sneezing, even though they have just sprayed me and everyone else with all those evil, influenza-inducing vibes.

We (meaning the US) have gone a little bit overboard in trying to quantify academic progress, although some measurement is valuable. It's just been corrupted in recent years for political purposes to convince us we're making progress in how we stack up nationally. In any case, I'd suggest getting students at ease in the standardized test taking environment. Give them some experience before test days with time constraints and answer grids. For goodness sake, don't make a test seem like the whole future of the school district is dependent on their performance! Talk about test anxiety!

"What is panna cotta?","Panna cotta means cooked cream in Italian and is very similar in consistency to a custard or flan but without the eggs. Typically it's served with fruit, syrup, or honey. One of my favorite recipes courtesy of Eric Ripert's Return to Cooking: Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Grapefruit Makes 4 servings Preparation Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 35 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling time Ingredients: 1 1/4 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup sugar 1 package granulated gelatin 1 3/4 cups buttermilk Vegetable oil cooking spray 3 large pink grapefruit 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons Vermont honey (or substitute another honey) Method: 1. Bring the cream and sugar to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Combine the gelatin and buttermilk. Once the cream has cooled, add the buttermilk-gelatin mixture and stir to combine. 2. Spray four (6-ounce) ramekins with vegetable spray. Divide the buttermilk-cream mixture between the ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. 3. Meanwhile, cut off the ends of the grapefruit. Using the tip of your knife, cut the peel and pith from the grapefruit. Hold the grapefruit over a bowl to catch the juice and cut out the segments from the fruit. Squeeze the membrane to release all the grapefruit juice. Refrigerate the grapefruit segments. Place the grapefruit juice (you should have at least 1 cup) in a small pot and add the vanilla extract. Bring to a boil and reduce by one third, about 30 minutes . Set aside. 4. To serve, dip the ramekins in hot water for 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around the edge of each ramekin and invert it onto the center of a plate. Arrange the grapefruit segments around the panna cotta in a spiraling fashion. Spoon the sauce over the grapefruit and drizzle the honey over the sauce. Serve immediately.","FoodDrink"

"Which part-time MBA program will add value to a software developer with 15 years experience?","Wow. There are some pretty negative answers in this thread. Pick a good program. Pick a highly rated program. The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA, and frankly, the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper. Here in the Bay Area, Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings, recently been in the top 10 for full time). I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region. Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program. I agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it. Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student. I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student. It opens a lot of doors. But you need to be very goal directed to get this value. I can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good. As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now. Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks. So - to your actual question. If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously). Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program. But talk to people, figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA, and then go from there.","EducationReference"
"Why do people put salt around the glass when drinking Margarita?","Salt is traditionally added to the rim of the glass to provide a sharp contrast in flavor to better experience the drink as a whole. The difference in the salt and the sugar content in the alcohol helps to stimulate all of your tastebuds, which are divided into sectors based on the type of sensation. Take caution to not over-salt the rim of the glass and thus coat only the outside portion of the rim around 1/4... getting salt on the inside of the glass risks modifying the flavor of the drink.","FoodDrink"

I think the combination of mystery/sci-fi aspects (which tends to get people pretty engrossed) with fairly effective storytelling (and cliffhanger) tactics, makes it popular.

With Lost, it's the same, but more serious. There is a strong numerology thread running through the first season at least, and that was intriguing to me personally (although I don't believe in numerology, I thought it was a fascinating device.) There was some amount of in-built fanbase too, as the guy who created Alias (JJ Abrams), also created Lost.

"Seems the vast majority of humans live long enough to procreate. Is natural selection dead (or sleepy)? If not, what are the attributes that are being selected for/against in humans these days?","Evolution is ever-present as always. You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event. Given that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it? Is average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents.","ScienceMathematics"

"what is a double layer DVD burner?","Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data. This is because they are pressed (as opposed to burned) dual-layer DVDs (also called DVD-9). The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes. This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD. Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably. So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd#Technical_information","ComputersInternet"

"First it's the one-click stuff, and now it's consumer reviews. Do they have a legal leg to stand on?","Amazon, like other companies, tries to patent its innovations for two reasons: 1. To gain a competitive advantage by excluding competitors from using its new ideas. For example, Amazon once sued Barnes and Noble over a patent. 2. To discourage competitors from filing patent infringement suits against Amazon. This concept is sometimes called Mutually Assured Destruction. The idea that Amazon or other companies are patenting existing or obvious ideas is incorrect. It's an urban legend fueled by people's unwillingness to read and understand the patents. The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) only grants patents on techniques that are *novel* and *non-obvious*. You can look up any granted US patent on the USPTO website, and roughly evaluate it by reading the broadest independent claim, which is usually claim #1. Remember, to infringe the claim, you have to have all the elements of the claim. Generally, the claims are narrower (less powerful) than people think. Do they have a legal leg to stand on? Once a patent is gratned by the USPTO, it has roughly a 50% chance of being upheld if brought to court.","ComputersInternet"

(e.g. they have a vertical jump of around 3-4 feet, and can squeeze themselves through openings far smaller than you suspect they could.) If you do decide to go for a humane trap, there are a couple of things you should keep in mind: 1) Unless you find out how he got in, there's no stopping him from coming back. Even if you don't plan on laying mouse death around the house, get an experienced exterminator in to help you identify where to patch up. 2) Mice will find their way back.

"How do you negotiate a job offer?","At the point you have a job offer, you are in the best position to negotiate. This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position. Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests. The other factor is the overall job market. In today's market, where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate. Now the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage. If one of your alternative offers pays more, you can allude to this vaguely. Even if they do not, you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge, the convience of the commute etc). This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash). Unless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%. Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond, and other forms you might accept (signing bonus, trading-up level/rank, etc). You should stay professional throughout the process, even if your offer is rejected. Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up, so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage. Ok. Hope that helps!","BusinessFinance"

For instance, the Accord has a racing derived double wishbone suspension at all four corners, resulting in a car with sharper handling than the camry. The Accord has also been mildly restyled for 2006, which in my opinion is a BIG improvement over the previous model. The gauges in the honda are electroluminiscent, which is immediately apparent when starting the car. The keys are RFID encoded to prevent theft.

"i'm looking to add sirius to my existing stock car stereo. i've got the starmate replay, but it uses an FM modulator to get the signal to my car stereo. with all the negative feedback i've read on using an FM modulator for connecting an ipod, i thought i'd see if there were other alternatives beyond getting a different head unit with sirius installed.","Depends on your factory stereo. If it has cd changer controls there is a chance you can use an aux input adapter, but if you already have a cd changer you can't have both the adapter and the input. See the link for a list. I believe all sirius units have a line output, even the ones that have FM modulators, so you should be ok with your current unit.","ConsumerElectronics"

"When is the next season of 24?","Look for 24 to return in January with a 4 hour 2part season premiere: Sunday January 15, 2006 and Monday January 16, 2006 I think FOX does this to have more original programming on the air year round. Since a normal tv season usually only contains about 24 episodes, they used to have to fill the rest of the year with reruns. By giving 24 a late start, you should get more consecutive new episodes with less reruns in between which helps keep people actively watching week after week. Currently the FOX drama Prison Break airs in 24's place and it is having its fall season finale next monday to make way for 24's return in January.","EntertainmentMusic"

"Why should I purchase a Lexus over a Mercedes and BMW?","The Lexus is a car for people who don't really like cars. They want cars to be comfortable, safe, cheap to own (particularly when you factor in depreciation), and high quality. In other words, if you view a car as an appliance and you just want it to do its job in as unobtrusive a way as possible, get the Lexus. They are trying to change this with their new models, but change comes slowly.    Mercedes-Benz cars are typically less luxurious and arguably built to a lower standard. They are filled with cutting-edge technology (Lexus is usually a couple years behind) and are quite enjoyable to drive, and are just as safe. They are also not quite as reliable, and they depreciate more quickly. Buy a Mercedes if you want luxury but also enjoy driving. If you really enjoy driving and don't mind a firmer ride, get a BMW.","CarsTransportation"

Additionally, it lets you skip the line to buy tickets in a lot of places - for example, we got to skip the line at Versailles, St. Chappelle, and Musee d'Orsay. It's also pretty nice to be able to go into (almost) any museum, if even for a brief while. We had a nice time spending a few hours in d'Orsay, then going to the Rodin museum for an hour, Invalides for 30 minutes, so on. It's nice that you can go sample a lot of different places, at least briefly. And, honestly, sometimes you go into the museum just to find a good restroom.","Travel"
"Should I buy Xbox or wait for PS3??","It all really depends on what you're looking for. A lot of people will tell you that the PS3 will have more games, which was the case with the PS2 and the Xbox. However, the Xbox represented Microsoft's first real foray into console gaming, so many developers were reluctant to get on board. However, after seeing the success of the Xbox combined with a 6-month (at least) headstart on Sony's next-gen console, and the incredible support that Microsoft offers its game development community, many more developers are signing on with the Xbox 360; particularly Japanese developers, which was a shortcoming with Microsoft's previous console. But really it comes down to what you're looking for. A lot of people will say that if you're looking for RPGs, you should go with the PS3, citing the PS2 as last generation's reigning RPG king in console gaming. Truly, it's a matter of preference. If you prefer Western-style RPGs like Morrowind, or Knights of the Old Republic, the 360 will offer a great deal more than the PS3. Even if you're looking for Eastern-style RPGs (i.e., Final Fantasy and such), you may want to look again. While the Xbox got little love from Japan's premier RPG developers, Square-Enix, the Xbox 360 is seeing a great deal of support coming from them. But then again, you've got the exclusive-title to consider. The Xbox 360 offers Halo 3, Perfect Dark Zero, among others. The PS3 has Metal Gear Solid 4, Devil May Cry, and more. So, it really comes down to what you're looking for. Still, the fact remains that Microsoft is a great deal more supportive of its developers, keeping the architecture simple and providing tools to make game production more efficient and cost-effective. On the otherhand, the PS3's technology is proving cumbersome and expensive (Source: http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/9503/Developers-Migrating-from-PS3-to-Xbox-360-Development/). This may also effect what games appear on what console. Technologically speaking, the two consoles are pretty evenly matched, though the PS3 has a leg up in some areas. The biggest advantage for the PS3 is the support of BluRay technology. This will allow developers to fit larger games on to the disc and increase performance. However, BluRay hasn't taken hold yet, and it's entirely possible that it won't become popular. The PS3 supports seven players, while the 360 supports four. So, if you're a social gamer, you may want to take that into account. Me? I can't stand split-screen. My biggest deciding factor is online support. The Xbox 360 will come with Xbox Live support. It's a tried and proven platform, and Microsoft has demonstrated that they have the saavy to provide a stable, user-friendly online experience. Plus, the service will only improve. Sony has said little to nothing about its online plans. So, if you're looking for massive online support, then the 360 is the clear winner. If you're still leaning towards the PS3, you'll have to wait for Sony to elaborate on any online plans they might have. In the end, I would say don't listen to me, or anyone else that happens to post an answer to this question. Hardcore gamers who take the time to answer this type of question, you'll find, are perhaps some of the most opinonated people you'll encounter on the web. We tend to be diehard supporters of our console of choice, and will often stop at nothing to sway anyone who will listen to our point of view. So, the answer you're looking for is this: Hit the web and do some research. Find out for yourself what each system has to offer and make your decision. If you need a few good sites to use for these purposes, I recommend the following: www.ign.com www.gamespot.com www.gamespy.com","GamesRecreation"

"As a novice runner, how many weeks/months do I need to properly train for a marathon?","The answer, of course, varies for each individual depending on how fit you are, how often do you train and what your goals are. If you are very aggressive, you can do it in 28 weeks. Start by walking, slowly, for a mile. Two days later, walk 1.5 miles. Every other day, increase the distance by half a mile until you get to 3 miles. Rest your muscles on the off day. Hold that distance on Tuesday and Thursday, while increasing by one additional mile on your weekend session (either Sat or Sun). Once the long walk reaches 10 miles you can cut the distance in half every other weekend, increasing the long one by 2 miles each time. When the long one gets to 18 miles, you can do it every third weekend, covering 8-9 miles on the short weekends. After about the third week of training, insert a one min jog into your runs, after 4 min of walking. If this feels fine after 2 weeks, drop to 3walk/1jog. After 3 more weeks, drop to 2-1. If all goes well after another 3 weeks or so you could go to 1-1 during the week, and 2walk/1jog on the long run. Find the ratio that works best for you, that will leave you feeling strong at the end, and recovering fast from these long ones. The pace for all of these should be very, very slow.","Health"

"How can I cure my hiccups?","This is to expand on another person's answer, which was correct but missing some important steps or explanation. This cure is a bonafide medical and scientific cure. The get rid of hiccups, you must deprive oxygen from the muscle that is causing hiccups. No oxygen to that muscle, it can't burn energy, no energy, no hiccups. So what needs to be done is to simulate DROWNING. We must trick the body to think it is drowning. This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body, like that muscle causing hiccups, to more important parts like the heart, the brain, the organs, etc. So...take a glass of water, slowly exhale. Pinch your nose. Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you can't take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water. Stop. Hold your breath for a few seconds, and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat. I have found this works 90% of the time. It only fails to work if there really is something stuck in your throat that really needs to be expelled by hiccups or coughing, or drinking lots of water.","Health"

"is it a good idea to lease a car? dare to share experience?","It is a fine idea to lease a car if: -Tend to switch cars every couple years -Drive a fairly consistent number of miles every year (which is under the limit) -You want to drive a car which is in demand and has a high resale value. -You have no interest in modifying your car Essentially, with a lease you are financing the depreciation of the car over the time you are driving it. For instance, for a 40K BMW, it may depreciate to around $28K after two years, so you finance the $12K difference. Since lease prices are tied to depreciation and not base price of a vehicle, you can afford a more expensive car than you would ordinarily be able to finance. Typically the best deals are through the finance arms of the manufacturers of the cars. Keep these facts in mind and you'll be fine.","CarsTransportation"

The Coupe was launched in europe at a HIGHER price point than the sedan, but because hatchbacks do not sell well in europe, MB USA decided to price it lower in the US. If you don't need rear seats the coupe offers more cargo versatility as well as the skyview roof, which gives you many of the advantages of a convertible with the security of a fixed roof. The C230 Coupe also has every safety feature available on the C240 sedan.    The C240 has a 168 HP V6 engine which is fairly weak, particularly with the sedan. There are two C230 coupes. They both have around 190 hp, but the newer models have a 1.8L aluminum engine, whereas the older models have a 2.3L iron engine. Both are reliable, but the 1.8 is the newer model. The way you can tell is by looking at the trim behind the front wheel. The 2.3 has no badge there but the 1.8 says 1.8 on the rubstrip. The 1.8L is supposed to handle and drive better and was released in 2003 I believe.","CarsTransportation"

"What is Visual Basic?","Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click). The language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop. In 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel.","ComputersInternet"

Kwanzaa too, is a celebration originating from the first harvest festivals of African peoples. According the official Kwanzaa site, The first-fruits celebrations are recorded in African history as far back as ancient Egypt and Nubia and appear in ancient and modern times in other classical African civilizations such as Ashantiland and Yorubaland. Kwanzaa was established in 1966 in the midst of the Black Freedom Movement to affirm the culture and identity of African American peoples and to unify them in a celebration of family, community, and a unique cultural heritage that had been supressed for many centuries under slavery. The seven symbols of Kwanzaa are spelled out in Swahili, an East African language. They are the crops, the mat, the candleholder, the corn, the seven candles, the unity cup, and the gifts. These symbols represent, respectively: the rewards of productive labor, tradition, African roots, children/the future, the Seven Principles, unity, and the love of parents/committment of children.","SocietyCulture"

While it is mostly still contained to birds, it is spreading rapidly and there have been reports of it spreading to humans. Excerpts from the CDC: Bird flu is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flu is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, very sick and kill them. Bird flu viruses do not usually infect humans, but several cases of human infection with bird flu viruses have occurred since 1997. The current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry in Asia and Europe (see below) is an example of a bird flu outbreak that has caused human infections and deaths. In such situations, people should avoid contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces, and should be careful when handling and cooking poultry. For more information about avian influenza and food safety issues, visit the the World Health Organization website Symptoms of bird flu in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of bird flu may depend on which virus caused the infection.","Health"

Some tropical trees are actually just fine down to occasional 20 degree temperatures. Other trees will just up and die at anything below freezing. Things you can do to protect a plant: + Water it. A well-watered plant can better protect itself from frost. + Cover it. Even a light cover can prevent a lot of damage. Just toss an old sheet over the tree. + Buy cloud cover. its a spray you can get from garden stores that will protect the leaves from damage. You'll have to reapply it after a rain. Obviously you can't do this all year so if you live in an area that freezes all winter you may just lose the plant. If you only get occasional frosts you'll have to pay attention to the weather. In general dry, still nights are worse than wet or windy nights. I find that if the teperature has dropped below 40 degrees and there's no wind by 9 or 10PM I'd better go out and cover my lemon trees. If its just cold and rainy I don't worry so much. Good luck!","HomeGarden"
"I care about the quality of the voice calls, UI, and size. I am reasonably happy w/ the Motorola V551, until it started to break down. Thanks for any advice!","Nokia 6682. It's not available from all/many Cingular stores as of last week, but they claim to be getting more in soon (apparently there was a firmware problem with some people's SIM cards). This phone has regularly been reviewed as one of the best of breed for smartphones that aren't hardcore PIMs (a la Treo, Blackberry). It's a phone first and foremost, but has Symbian OS, and there are a ton of apps you can add to it. Plus, great bluetooth compatibility and a reasonable size (not quite as small as the V551 you have, but much nicer screen IMO... and a better camera.) Probably the best phone (PHONE!) Cingular has at the moment. If you can't find one at the Cingular store, you can order it from Nokia's site directly and apparently, keep your existing plan (I think... there's a phone number to validate that as you get through the checkout process.) Or just buy one anywhere, as long as it's unlocked, your Cingular SIM will work as long as it's not one of the 3G cards.","ConsumerElectronics"
"Why are the Dutch so tall?","As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4 I should be able to answer this one. Specifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being the tallest nation in the world. The average dutchman is about 6'1 (4 taller than the avg american) Research shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height. So to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow..oh and a bit of genetics. From a research report: Genetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. Miranda Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children. Lastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height..","ScienceMathematics"

"What are the best places to see in San Francisco?","Where to begin! San Francisco is a great place to visit, and it holds new surprises every time you return. If you've never been before, you may enjoy staying someplace central like Union Square. From there you can BART to the Mission district and as far south as SF Airport, or to the Embarcadero and all the way to the East Bay. Your other public transportation options are the cable car (which picks up right at Powell and Market) and the bus. There are several bus lines that can take you all throughout the city from here. Union Square also houses many upscale shops and some very nice restaurants. I recommend lunch at the Rotunda in Nieman Marcus, which affords a view of all of Union Square. You can take the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf from here. Although it is very touristy, it also gives you a glimpse of what the shipping and canning industry used to be like here. You can also check out the very entertaining Amusing America at Pier 45. You have lots of great seafood dining options in this area. The Embarcadero is very much improved in these past few years. It's now a great promenade and hosts a Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building a couple of times a week. Nearby Embarcadero Center is another shopping destination. If you're here in the spring/summer, definitely try to catch a Giants game at SBC Park, which is a world class ball park! If you come in summer, you'll likely run into one of the many street fairs that happen in neighborhoods throughout the city. Lots of good food, interesting crafts, live music and a real taste of San Francisco. There are a lot of terrific museums here. Downtown you'll find the SF MoMA, which is a decent collection in a gorgeous building. Right across the street is Yerba Buena Gardens and the Metreon, where you can catch a movie, play a game of billiards or even go virtual bowling. The DeYoung just reopened in a brand new building. That will put you right in the heart of Golden Gate Park, which has bike paths, gardens, a conservatory of flowers, the Japanese tea garden, man-made lakes, and even a bison paddock. You'll get a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marina Green and Crissy field, both of which are great for walking, exercising, and just plain people watching! I could go on and on! San Francisco has something to offer everyone, and is worth more than one trip!","Travel"
"Can animals really predict earthquakes?","There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. You may want to test that theory. The program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. One theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. Anyway, you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations.","ScienceMathematics"

"How would these courses improve overall teacher quality?","Being an Master Educator myself, I would say that courses should be required that not only provide teachers-in-training a mastery of their content area, but also a better understanding of pedagogy, classroom management, and how to integrate technology into their classroom. I would also agree with the previous poster about ethics training. The content area knowledge would make them more knowledgable and therefore more capable of effectively communicating the important aspects of what they are teaching preferably in ways other than the standard lecture. Similarly, I am seeing that many new teachers are coming out with a less than ideal level of knowledge with regard to the pedagogical implications of their teaching techniques. By spending more time on how to effectively differentiate instruction and deliver exciting lessons, many new teachers would be ahead of the game. Additionally, classroom management is an important skill that is normally only taught (experientially) during field experiences. Knowing that this is generally an area of concern for new teachers more emphasis should be placed on it. Finally, integrating technology would help teachers to move away from standard textbooks, which while adequate, don't provide students the depth of knowledge they need to really understand the materials they are learning. The sum-total of all of these parts is a more well rounded teacher who is better prepared to engage students and enjoy a very rewarding career as a teacher.","EducationReference"

"Can someone *simply* explain what a stock short is?","Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this: When you think a stock is going to go down... 1. You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker. 2. You sell those shares at today's price. 3. You wait for the stock to go down. 4. You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price. 5. You return the borrowed shares. 6. You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price. Steps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker. The advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down. (With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.) The disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money. For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment.

"Who the heck is the Dalai Lama?","The Dalai Lama is a spiritual and secular ruler of some Buddhists in Tibet (and around the ruler). There are other lamas -- leaders of other followers who belong to other sects of Tibetan Buhhism. Tenzin Gyatso (Tibetan: བསྟན་འཛིན་རྒྱ་མཚོ་ Wylie: Bstan 'dzin Rgya mtsho) (b. July 6, 1935) is the fourteenth and current Dalai Lama. The fifth of nine children of a farming family in the Tibetan province of Amdo, he was proclaimed the tulku (reincarnation) of the thirteenth Dalai Lama at the age of three. On November 17, 1950, at the age of fifteen, he was enthroned as Tibet's Head of State and most important political ruler, while Tibet faced occupation by the forces of the People's Republic of China. After the collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement in 1959, Tenzin Gyatso fled to India, where he was active in establishing the government of Tibet in exile and preserving Tibetan culture and education among the thousands of refugees who accompanied him. A charismatic figure and noted public speaker, Tenzin Gyatso is the first Dalai Lama to travel to the West, where he has helped to spread Buddhism and to publicise the cause of Free Tibet. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (taa-la'i bla-ma) form a tulku lineage of Gelugpa leaders which trace back to 1391. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the present incarnation of Avalokitesvara (Chenrezig [spyan ras gzigs] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, controlling a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lamas never had authority over every region of Tibet nor over the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism. The current Dalai Lama (the 14th) is a respected Tibetan Buddhist religious leader and figurehead of the International Tibet Independence Movement; in English, he is often granted the style His Holiness (or HH) before his title.","NewsEvents"

From an IT perspective S-Ox compliance revolves around preserving information and ensuring that the systems that maintain financial records are capturing all the correct data.

"What is the difference between dating and in a relationship?","The difference is the level of commitment. Dating connotes a casual thing, not necessarily exclusive. When a person says I'm dating Bill instead of Bill is my boyfriend, you can probably guess the relationship is relatively new and no commitment has been made.     When you've decided you're in a relationship, you'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend. You'll introduce each other to your close friends and family. You'll likely spend a LOT of time together, and may take it for granted that you'll see each other certain nights and weekends. Depending on your lifestyle, you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.    If you're uncomfortable discussing taking things to the next level you're probably just dating, and not quite ready for a relationship.","FamilyRelationships"

Questions from the House--especially from the opposition--are designed to get him off his game and distract him from the prepared text, in the hope of making him look bad. (A similar game is played by many television correspondents: If the interviewee gives a pat answer, ask the question ten more times. Play only the most emotive response.) By referring the questioner back to the earlier, prepared answer, the P.M. short-circuits this tactic. Stilted, but effective.","PoliticsGovernment"

Reinhard?!","According to this page in the French wikipedia, Reinhard comes from Regin + Hard (strong advice as you mention) http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Renart Interestingly, the page goes on to say that the word renard (French for fox) comes from Reinhard! Reinhard was the name of the fox (originally goupil in French) in a famous story Reynard the fox, but due to the popularity of the fox character, the French name for fox became renard instead of goupil. Reinhard : Voir Renard pour le sens. Le nom est porté en Alsace-Lorraine. Variantes : Reinhardt, Reinhart, Reinharth, Reinard, Reinardt, Reinartz, Reinert, Reinertz. Renard, Renart Nom de personne d'origine germanique, Raginhard (ragin = conseil + hard = dur). Faut-il le rappeler, le nom commun renard est au départ un prénom, et c'est la popularité du goupil, nommé Renart dans le célèbre roman médiéval, qui en a fait peu à peu un nom commun.

"Why do non-Vegetarians get so defensive at the mere mention that one is a Vegetarian?","Maybe because they feel put-upon by your 'special request'. If you tell a party host you're a Vegetarian, he may feel that you expect him to provide extra food that would be suitable for you. If you tell a date you're a Vegetarian, he may feel that his choice of date restaurants is limited by your lifestyle. Or are you in their face about your Vegetarianism? If you're an activist, they may feel that you are judging their choice to eat meat. You'll win people over to your way of living if you aren't demanding and are flexible with your choices. If you're invited to a dinner party, offer to bring a Vegetarian dish to share with the others. If you're invited out to dinner, be armed with restaurant choices that can accomodate you. Ethnic restaurants are usually a safe bet. Don't push your beliefs on others, but definitely share them if asked. Vegetarianism is a very personal choice, so know that your personal story will be more compelling than political statements.","Health"

Java, on the other hand, is written in C. Most modern development platforms have a foundation in C. If this question is to choose a language path for school, I think either Java or C is fine. Though I would say that you will become a better programmer if you have a more detailed understanding of what is under the hood. In that case C (and a bit of assembly isn't bad to at least take a look at). The more higher-level you go, the less you can ultimately do.","ComputersInternet"
"What are the odds of life on another planet?","Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation. Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets. As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on. So when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt. If you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high. The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming. Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life. It's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself. Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand. The best guess that scientists have put forward right now is: N = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211 where N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year. To get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms: 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3 So about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.","ScienceMathematics"

You can't get credit (a card or loan) without a credit history and you can't build a credit history without credit. One can start breaking this by getting a credit card with some stores, as recommended earlier, since they have lower bars of acceptance. Another way that is less harmful to your credit report is to apply for a pre-paid credit card from your bank. This is somewhat like a debit card, you put up money upfront and can then spend upto that amount. However, the difference is that it is still treated as credit and starts a positive credit history for you. After a few months, you can upgrade to a normal credit card from the bank and then a few months later apply for a credit card or loan from elsewhere","BusinessFinance"

"What is your opinion on online dating?","It works. I met my bf of almost 3 years through online dating. That doesn't mean I didn't meet alot of incompatible people. I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him. Online dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people. If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience. It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome. Yes, even a bad date can be fun. Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends. I find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work. Then, it's up and down for awhile depending on who you come into contact with. When it doesn't feel fun anymore, TAKE A BREAK. Come back in a few months. Change your profile to reflect how you're feeling. It's important that you feel good about yourself or you won't attract the people you want because who wants to be with someone who's down on themselves? Online dating is really a reflection of how you're feeling. When you feel good about yourself, your online experience improves. When you feel bad, it tends to be a not so good experience. I was about to pull my dating profile because I found I was meeting lots of people through offline methods. However, my friend pointed out that it wasn't costing me anything (financially or emotionally) if I just left my profile up. I thought she made a good point, so I decided to rewrite my profile one last time and put it out there. When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me. Instead, I wrote a profile that reflected exactly how I felt and who I was at that moment. And then, I started to meet interesting people. Shortly thereafter, I met my bf and things have been going well since.","FamilyRelationships"

A woman in Hawaii had requested a Guide Dog for her disabled husband with allergies. It took a while for Conran to hit upon the right mix, but the first litter produced three puppies, one of whose hair and saliva did not affect the man's allergies. He began breeding and cross-breeding the Labradoodles, which were in high demand almost immediately. The mix reputedly combines the intelligence, aloof nature, the delicate frame, and the low-allergy, and non-shedding traits of the poodle with the boisterous exuberance, lovability, and loyalty of a lab.","Pets"

I have professional photographer friends who use it as their primary camera. 8 megapixels and it's not crippled like the former Digital Rebel. Also one of the smallest and lightest DSLR's on the market. Consistently one of the most highly rated cameras, see the link below for a detailed review. Canon DSLR's are highly regarded and their lenses seem to be of comparable quality to Nikon while generally being cheaper. A big advantage that Canon has is their vertical integration, they have the ability to engineer the electronics, lenses, and sensors all in house and save the best for themselves. This is the best camera you can get for under $1000. I've seen it for as low as $700 in some places. I would also not be too hung up on the megapixel rating. The 6.3 megapixel Nikon D50 and D70s are both great cameras and will take significant better pictures than 8 megapixel consumer digicams without interchangeable lenses. However, unless I had a signficant investment in Nikon lenses, I would get the Canon. Higher resolution, arguably better picture quality, and a lower price.","ConsumerElectronics"

"What can be done to lower the dropout rate in High Schools?","To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention. In other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. Each learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. The NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student. One of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning. hope this helps!","EducationReference"

"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?","This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny. In the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along. So the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?","ScienceMathematics"

"What's the best John Coltrane album?","Coltrane's Sound This album is like many Coltrane albums palpably in transition between styles. It follows on from the experiments with dense, irregularly moving chord changes of Giant Steps, and also contains a couple reharmonized standards, The Night Has a Thousand Eyes and Body and Soul, which have areas of sustained modal exploration in the manner of My Favourite Things. The band is the first edition of the classic Coltrane band, with Steve Davis on bass before Jimmy Garrison hopped on board. What's most unusual about this album, perhaps, is that it's actually Coltrane's meditation on the bop heritage. Only one tune is completely original, the lovely ballad Central Park West (one of my favourite Coltrane tracks; he only states the melody, leaving the improvisation to Tyner, but it's so rounded a statement that like Monk's Crepuscule with Nellie it doesn't really need elaboration at all). The other tunes rework standard bop fare via the techniques of movement in thirds and pedal notes that obsessed Coltrane in this period. Liberia is a version of A Night in Tunisia; Equinox is a minor blues but borrows its intro from Parker's intro to Star Eyes; Satellite is a reworking of How High the Moon/Ornithology; 26-2 (a rather mysterious title) is a version of Confirmation. The practice was of course already there on _Giant Steps_ (Giant Steps and Countdown are themselves based on standards like Tune Up) but the concentration of such material, & the tenor sax shibboleth Body and Soul, suggest a rather more self-conscious exploration of the tradition. (Note that Coltrane's albums otherwise rarely contain bop tunes, preferring to concentrate on pop standards when not playing originals.) The quartet's take on these tunes is dark, intense and brooding--this album is a long way from the sunny mood of _Giant Steps_ & _Coltrane Jazz_.","ArtsHumanities"

Applying concealer will help. I like Bobbi Brown's Creamy Concealer. For very dark circles, I use their Corrector.

"How can we improve the quality of the teachers in high schools?","hi, This question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. There are several areas to focus on improving teachers: 1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS. 2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers. 3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements. 4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff. 5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important. hope this helps?","EducationReference"

"in which movie he had introduced more new techniques the any of his movies?","Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too. Notorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. Essentially, this is the plot device that everything seems to be hinging upon while the story is doing something else (much sneakier) in the background. In Notorious, the McGuffin is (are) the wine bottles full of uranium. I tend to think that Vertigo is his best because it's just so damn unbelievable and over-the-top but he still pulls it off.

"How can we make teaching more attractive to young people?","Higher salaries- for the amount of education that a teacher has to have, their pay is a pittance. What other careers do you know where people with a master's degree in their chosen field start out around $35,000/ year, or less? The pay level is ridiculous- so low that teachers usually can not live on their salaries unless they are married to someone else who works, or have a second job. Second, reduce the workload. Most don't realize that a teacher's workday is not limited to 8 hours or so they are at school. When you add in the lesson planning and grading that must be done on your own time, the constant parent conferences, meetings, paperwork and evaluations, and training sessions that they throw at you, you're normally working the equivalent of 10-12 hour days, and filling up your entire weekends with it. Then add in more trainings and classes that they require you to take during your vacation times, and there's practically no break. Third- allow them to teach!! So much of the time is taken up with madated tests, evaluations, and forced mucky muck that teaching doesn't get to happen anywhere near as often as it should. And lastly- give teachers a break! Literally. Breaks are few and far between and dreadful are the times when you have to go and can't because there is no one else to watch your class.

"what is the reason behind thanksgiving holidays?","The Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, MA provides a history of the original Thanksgiving and the subsequent history of the holiday with references to both primary and secondary sources. The website link is below. About half of the original group of Mayflower passengers coming to America had perished during the voyage or during the first year. The 50 or so surviving Pilgrims celebrated their first successful harvest in the Fall of 1621 in Plymouth, MA. This is considered the origin of the present-day Thanksgiving. It was a harvest celebration with prayers of thanksgiving for provision, and safety. And being Puritan Separatists, the giving of thanks was to their God, Jesus Christ. The website discusses additional details concerning the English-speaking Indians, the mix of passengers, and the Mayflower compact. Regarding the evolution of the holiday, the website contains the text of the annual Thanksgiving proclamations of Congress and the President since 1777. The first Continental Congress published the first such proclamation expressing gratefulness to God for the outcome of the War of Independence. George Washington published the first Presidential proclamation in 1789 expressing gratefulness to God for the establishment of the new form of government. However, observance of the holiday remained, effectively, an optional state initiative until Lincoln declared a national, annual Thanksgiving holiday in October of 1863. He was moved by events in the Civil War. In this proclamation Lincoln expresses gratitude to God for protection from foreign threats during the Civil War and preservation of the union in the Civil War. Presidents have declared an annual, national day of Thanksgiving ever since. In 1939 it is said FDR tried to move the day of Thanksgiving up to extend the Christmas season. The resulting controversy motivated Congress to fix the date in 1941 to the 4th Thursday in November, which is where it remains to this date.","SocietyCulture"

"I'm by no means an audiophile, but would like a decent home theater sound system. What do i need to look out for when buying a used system? I don't want to invest in a dead technology. At a minimum, what should I look for?","At a minimum you want 5.1 audio with both DTS and Dolby Digital support. Beyond that you see diminishing returns, as there's a HUGE leap between Dolby Pro Logic and Dolby Digital sound. Essentially the 5.1 means there are 5 independent full range channels with a completely independent LFE (low frequency effects) channel. The difference between DTS and Dolby Digital are subtle at best, theoretically DTS is a less compressed format with higher resolution but in the end it comes down the the sound engineering behind the tracks for each individual movie. However, it's now virtually standard on all receivers and there are many DTS encoded dvds now. There are a few newer standards like Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES which add an extra center channel or two to the rear, but in my opinion the extra cost of the speakers is better spent on building a solid 5 speaker (+ subwoofer) system. Also, in the home placing a rear center channel is problematic and in my opinion more trouble than it's worth. If you can get a higher end and better built (but older) 5.1 receiver, that's a much better use of your money than a lower end 7.1 system. Also, the new formats are completely backward compatible with the older ones, so there are no compatibility issues with older gear. The 5.1 standards have been out for about 10 years now, but there are no real breakthroughs on the home theater front. The only thing that I would recommend in terms of future proofing is a set of 5.1 channel inputs on your receiver for an external decoder, though at this point I don't know what that new audio standard would be. I haven't really mentioned the high def audio formats like SACD or DVD Audio because there isn't a lot of media and to truly take advantage of the better sound you'd have to make a BIG investment in speakers and improving the acoustics of your room. For speakers, definitely don't skimp. My favorite brands (bang for the buck) are Paradigm, PSB, and Energy. Energy has a sub/sat line called the Take 5 which is all the speakers + subwoofer you need for around $700. There is a newer model called act6 which is around $800 and is quite good. In terms of receivers, Denon is good all around, and Yamaha makes good receivers towards the high end. Onkyo is also good. Sony is not great. Lots of features and nice looking gear but sonically not as good as Denon, Onkyo, or the nicer Yamahas. When in doubt, see if the receiver is made in Japan. Usually the Japanese brands reserve their higher spec gear from the Japanese plants. There is plenty of good stuff which is not made there, but if it is you're in good shape. I have a Yamaha RXV-2095 which I bought in 1999 and I feel like I have no reason to upgrade for the next few years. It's a solid receiver with lots of clean amplification. Also, if five speakers is a lot of scratch, you can still have great home theater with just the 3 front speakers and a subwoofer.","ConsumerElectronics"
"Is one better than the other?","Depends on the kind of driving you do. There are two types of hybrid systems, parallel and series. A parallel hybrid, like the Toyota and Ford systems, employs a separate electric motor and gas engine,connected in parallel to the wheels. Systems like these tend to be better for city driving, and this is usually reflected in the higher EPA city ratings for parallel hybrids. Parallel hybrids have, until very recently, been the only system that allows independent operation of the electric and gas motors, where the car can operate in pure electric mode at low speeds when the battery has a good charge. The Honda employs a series hybrid where the motor is integrated into the transmission and is connected in series to the drive wheels. These systems typically offer better highway mileage than parallel hybrids but slightly worse around town. Also typical with these systems is the inability to run the car in pure electric mode, though this has changed with the 2006 Civic Hybrid. While the Prius has been the state of the art in hybrid technology, it is my opinion that the new 2006 Civic Hybrid is the superior vehicle. It was designed from the ground up with the Prius as a benchmark, and the designers have hit their mark. I think the Civic will end up being a better driving experience. The platform was engineered to be the basis for the next generation of Honda vehicles, and the 2006 Civic Si, also based on the same platform, is considered to be the best in its class. The hybrid shares the same basic suspension as the Si, and will undoubtedly be compatible with the multitude of aftermarket suspension upgrades which will become available shortly for the 2006 civic.","CarsTransportation"

"She's healthy so why?","She's definitely healthy! There are all kinds of reasons why your dog is groaning. Dogs groan because they're in pain or afraid (soft groan), excited (gasping), wanting something (continuous groaning), communicating with others (howling), or just sighing of boredom or disappointment. If you're worried that she's groaning because she's in pain or there could be something wrong, take her to her vet -- someone I'm sure would be able to figure out what's so upsetting to her.

"What is the best type of food/cuisine (i.e., American, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, etc)?","Why limit yourself? I have the good fortune to live in a city where all of these cuisines is well-represented among our restaurants. I pick whichever one fits my mood at the time. American: filling, simple, can often be eaten with hands, usually family-friendly fare Chinese: share dishes, can range from bland to quite spicy, excellent starchy rice and noodle dishes, restaurants can accomodate large parties Indian: sauces are subtle with very unusual flavors, tends to be heavier than other cuisines, order a thali if you want little tastes of lots of different foods Thai: usually lighter than Chinese, with subtly different ingredients (e.g. lemongrass), excellent beef dishes Mediterranean: food tends to be blander but long on unusual ingredients (e.g. chickpea flour), most dishes are eaten with your hands, excellent for a family meal. Many Meditteranean restaurants feature belly dancing and live music for a full dining experience","FoodDrink"
