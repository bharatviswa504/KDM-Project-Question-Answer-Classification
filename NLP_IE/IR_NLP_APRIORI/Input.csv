I didn't expect to have any of it.  I was much sicker than I thought I was.  I was probably very sick and they probably didn't have a lot of time for them to do those things, so probably it was done as well as could be expected.
Yes.  I think the attendants were, I think they waited on me and they were polite and did everything I asked, if it was possible.
I was moved several times and I think that probably that could have been avoided it would have been better, but I think that they were having problems with space.  I was in ICU and then moved out and then moved back and I think that I was moved according to what was convenient for them.  But then I may have, since I don't know the reason, I may have been moved simply because there were no people to take care of.  I don't know.  It may have been a personnel matter.  I just know that I was moved at least 3 times.
Yes.  The first time they said it was to a better room.  Then the next time they said it was back to ICU but I needed to go back.  Then the third time, I don't think they gave me a reason the third time.
I am not sure I know.  Like I said, I was much sicker than I thought and as the time passes now after that, I think I was much sicker than I even thought while I was in the hospital.  I know that I wanted to go home and it wasn't possible to do that.  I had to be on oxygen - I even had oxygen after I got home - but there were reasons I had to be there and maybe that you could say the discomfort I had or anything that I didn't like about it, probably might have been the best they could do.  I don't know.
I thought it was better than half, but like I said I wasn't totally enamored of it, but probably it was not bad.  I should say.
No, I don't know.  Probably they didn't have time or not able to anesthetize or, it was painful that they had not ?? To do that. I know that my mouth, from being intubated, my mouth did not heal up for, well it was healing up for about a month. 
 And the catheterization, I got a bladder infection after that.   I am still dealing with whatever they did with the catheterization.  But again, I am saying it may have been the best they could do.  Nobody likes to be catheterized or intubated.  If they are doing it on an emergency basis, it probably is the best they can do.
Just to help me get up and go to the bathroom, that sort of thing.
That was about it.  I didn't want much.  That is about all I ever required of them was help getting out of bed.
But then I think probably I was given as much pain medication as they could give me because I had trouble breathing. So I think probably they gave as much as they could.  But, from my standpoint of how comfortable I was, no more than a 7.
Probably more communication.  Just telling me, no we can't do that because.  Like I said, I had no idea of how sick I was and nobody told me how sick I was.
No.  I don't think I asked for more pain medication.  Probably more like sleep medication.  Maybe that was it.  Because like I said I don't know that I was in terrible pain.  I know that I did not sleep a lot.  It seemed like I hardly slept at all.  So probably that was more descriptive that I did not sleep rather than I was in terrible pain.
I probably didn't ask for sleep medication.  I did at one time and they said no, that the test they were running I had to go to sleep by myself or something like that.  So again, I am saying that they probably did as much as they could.
I didn't feel much of a personal connection with the aides at all.  I don't know that they explained anything in particular to me, except that one time I mentioned that they could help me with sleep.  I was supposed to be reacting to some kind of test they were giving me.  But I didn't feel much personal connection to any of them really.
I guess I didn't feel that I was particularly connected in any way to any of them.  I did not have a favorite or anything.  In fact, I don't know that the same people waited on me every day or not.  It was just a.  I did not connect.
If they had enough time and personnel, they could have had somebody come in and talk to me and tell me.  I didn't even know until after I was home and my personal physician called me, that he did not do any of the orders.  The hospital had my case and the doctor had come to see me, but he hadn't changed the orders in any way.  Anyway, he called a couple of days after I was home and told me what had been wrong with me.  But I didn't know when I was there really, even what was wrong with me.
I would like to have had one person come in and see if I had any questions and tell me what was wrong with me and if I had any questions about it.  Again, I will say that I did not know how sick I was so maybe they did these things and I did not know it, but I did not feel any particular connection with anybody.
I don?t know.  They probably can't use a nurse that way.  I realize the cost of personnel is overwhelming but they might have a social worker or somebody, somebody who has time to talk for a few minutes.
Yes.  But I didn't realize how lacking it had been until after I was home and realized I had no idea what they had done to me, other than the things that still hurt.
The nurses, nurses' aides, very kind.  Always asking if you needed them to get you anything or if you are comfortable and warm enough and that sort of thing.
Probably the only thing and this is probably standard procedure for a hospital, but the only thing is answering the same questions to so many different people.  Such as 2 to 3 doctors, 3 to 5 nurses and they just seemed to ask all the same questions.
And the purpose of some of the questions is just to see if you are progressing or regressing, but a lot of the questions were just very redundant. I don't know if they needed to have more communication amongst themselves or what, I dont know what procedure is at the hospital.  It might just be standard procedure.  I do not know.  It just seemed kind of redundant, but as far as the hospital overall and the comfort. it was real nice.  The staff is very  helpful.
As far as the hospital bed itself and the fact that they made sure you were warm enough or cool enough, whatever.
Absolutely.  I was pretty sick, so I really didn't care.  But absolutely.  This is what a hospital should be.  It was clean.  There wasn't any grime and such in the bathroom.  It was a very nice experience as far as being in a hospital.
Not really.  Just the professionalism I guess was there.  They did not want to intrude on you too much.  They had to do their job and check your vitals and everything quite often.  That is part of it.
Probably less sensitivity in the device, whatever the device might me.  The last visit I did not have such a device which was nice.  I was still rated a fall risk, just the same, but they checked on you and if you were monitored electronically with that one.  So if my heart rate went up, they knew I was up to something in there so they would come check on me.  I liked it a little more than the sensitivity of the automatic beeper that would go off.
