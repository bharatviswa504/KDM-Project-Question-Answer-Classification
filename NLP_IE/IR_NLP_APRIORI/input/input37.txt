Epidemiology[edit]
Figures for incidences of cancers of the brain show a significant difference between more- and less-developed countries (the less-developed countries have lower incidences of tumors of the brain) — this could be explained by undiagnosed tumor-related deaths (patients in extreme poor situations do not get diagnosed, simply because they do not have access to the modern diagnostic facilities required to diagnose a brain tumor) and by deaths caused by other poverty-related causes that preempt a patient's life before tumors develop or tumors become life-threatening. Nevertheless studies[which?] suggest that certain forms of primary brain tumors are more prevalent among certain groups of the population.

The incidence of low-grade astrocytoma has not been shown to vary significantly with nationality. However, studies examining the incidence of malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors have shown some variation with national origin. Since some high-grade lesions arise from low-grade tumors, these trends are worth mentioning. Specifically, the incidence of CNS tumors in the United States, Israel, and the Nordic countries is relatively high, while Japan and Asian countries have a lower incidence. These differences probably reflect some biological differences as well as differences in pathologic diagnosis and reporting.[34] Worldwide data on incidence of cancer can be found at the WHO (World Health Organisation) and is handled by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) located in France.[35]

United States[edit]
For the United States in the year 2005, it was projected that there would be 43,800 new cases of brain tumors [36][37] which accounted for less than 1 percent of all cancers, 2.4 percent of all cancer deaths,[38] and 20–25 percent of pediatric cancers.[38][39] Ultimately, it is estimated there are 13,000 deaths per year in the United States alone as a result of brain tumors.[37]

UK[edit]
Brain, other CNS or intracranial tumours are the ninth most common cancer in the UK (around 9,400 people were diagnosed in 2011), and it is the eighth most common cause of cancer death (around 5,200 people died in 2012).[40]

Research[edit]
Vesicular stomatitis virus[edit]
In 2000, researchers at the University of Ottawa, led by John Bell, discovered that the vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, can infect and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells if coadministered with interferon.[41][42]
