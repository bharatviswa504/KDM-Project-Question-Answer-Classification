Adults[edit]
The most common malignant primary intraocular tumor in adults is uveal melanoma. These tumors can occur in the choroid, iris and ciliary body. The latter are sometimes called iris or ciliary body melanoma.
The next most common is primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) which is usually non-Hodgkinâ€™s, large cell lymphoma of the B-cell type, although T cell lymphomas have also been described.
Children[edit]
The most common malignant intraocular tumor in children is retinoblastoma, affecting approximately 325 children per year in North America. Early detection has allowed for cures exceeding 95%.[1]
The second most common is medulloepithelioma (also called diktyoma) which can occur in the ciliary body and the uvea of the eye.
Benign[edit]
Orbital dermoid cysts are benign choristomas which are typically found at the junction of sutures, most commonly at the fronto-zygomatic suture. Large deep orbital dermoid cysts can cause pressure effects on the muscles and optic nerve, leading to diplopia and loss of vision.
