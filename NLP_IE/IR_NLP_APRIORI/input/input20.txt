Risk factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma include:[2][3][4][31]

Age, gender, and race; the risk of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age. Most cases occur after age 65,[4] while cases before age 40 are uncommon. The disease is slightly more common in men than women, and in the United States is over 1.5 times more common in African Americans, though incidence in Africa is low.[4]
Cigarette smoking is the best-established avoidable risk factor for pancreatic cancer, approximately doubling risk among long-term smokers, the risk increasing with the number of cigarettes smoked and the years of smoking. The risk declines slowly after smoking cessation, taking some 20 years to return to almost that of non-smokers.[32]
Obesity; a BMI greater than 35 increases relative risk by about half.[3]
Family history; 5–10% of pancreatic cancer cases have an inherited component, where people have a family history of pancreatic cancer.[2] The risk escalates greatly if more than one first-degree relative had the disease, and more modestly if they developed it before the age of 50.[6] Most of the genes involved have not been identified.[2][33] Hereditary pancreatitis gives a greatly increased lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer of 30–40% to the age of 70.[5] Screening for early pancreatic cancer may be offered to individuals with hereditary pancreatitis on a research basis.[34] Some people may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent cancer developing in the future.[5]
Pancreatic cancer has been associated with the following other rare hereditary syndromes: Peutz–Jeghers syndrome due to mutations in the STK11 tumor suppressor gene (very rare, but a very strong risk factor); dysplastic nevus syndrome (or familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, FAMMM-PC) due to mutations in the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene; autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia and autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene and PALB2 gene; hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome); and familial adenomatous polyposis. PanNETs have been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and von Hippel Lindau syndromes.[2][5][6]
Chronic pancreatitis appears to almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis may be a symptom of a tumor.[5] The risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with familial pancreatitis is particularly high.[5][33]
Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.[5]
Specific types of food (as distinct from obesity) have not been clearly shown to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.[2] Dietary factors for which there is some evidence of slightly increased risk include processed meat, red meat, and meat cooked at very high temperatures (e.g. by frying, broiling or barbecuing).[35][36]
Alcohol[edit]
Drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer. However, considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong confounding factor. The evidence is stronger for a link with heavy drinking, of at least six drinks per day.[5][37]
