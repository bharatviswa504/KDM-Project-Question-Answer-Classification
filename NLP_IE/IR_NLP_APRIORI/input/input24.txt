Pancreatic cancer metastasized â€“ stage M1
Locally advanced adenocarcinomas have spread into neighboring organs, which may be any of the following (in roughly decreasing order of frequency): the duodenum, stomach, transverse colon, spleen, adrenal gland, or kidney. Very often they also spread to the important blood or lymphatic vessels and nerves that run close to the pancreas, making surgery far more difficult. Typical sites for metastasic spread (stage IV disease) are the liver, peritoneal cavity and lungs, all of which occur in 50% or more of fully advanced cases.[42]

PanNETs[edit]
The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system grades all the neuroendocrine tumors into three categories, based on their degree of cellular differentiation (from "NET G1" through to the poorly differentiated "NET G3").[17] The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[43]:52 Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar to those of the exocrine cancers.[44] A different TNM system for PanNETs has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.[17]
