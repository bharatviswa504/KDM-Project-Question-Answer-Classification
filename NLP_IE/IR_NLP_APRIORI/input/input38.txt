Types[edit]
Tumors can be benign or malignant, can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a metastatic tumor, which is something that has spread to the brain from another part of the body.[14] The incidence of metastatic tumors are more prevalent than primary tumors by 4:1.[15] Tumors may or may not be symptomatic: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.

The most common primary brain tumors are:[16]

Gliomas (50.4%)
Meningiomas (20.8%)
Pituitary adenomas (15%)
Nerve sheath tumors (8%)
These common tumors can also be organized according to tissue of origin as shown below:[17][verification needed]
