Physical agents
Some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.[51] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[51] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers, such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[51] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite).[51] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.[51]

Physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[52] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have never been proven.[52] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer.[52] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[52] Frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[52] Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma.[52] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.

It is controversial whether chronic inflammation can directly cause mutation.[52][53] It is recognized, however, that inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the microenvironment around tumors.[54][55] Furthermore, oncogenes are known to build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.[56]

Hormones
Some hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[57] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[58]

Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and testis, and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[57] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[57] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry, and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer.[57] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[57]

Other factors are also relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[57] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[57] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones, and lower risk of cancer.[57] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[57] Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.[57]
