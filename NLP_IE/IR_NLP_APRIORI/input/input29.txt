Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.[2] Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur.[2] Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor.[2] Some tumors grow slowly, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention.[2] Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied.[1] Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis.[4] Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes.[4] The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the United States is 33%.[5]

Secondary or metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors,[1] with about half of metastases coming from lung cancer.[1] Primary brain tumors occur in around 250,000 people a year globally, making up less than 2% of cancers.[4] In children younger than 15, brain tumors are second only to acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a cause of cancer.[6] In Australia the average economic cost of a case of brain cancer is $1.9 million, the greatest of any type of cancer.[7]


Signs and symptoms of a brain tumor mainly depend on the size of the tumor and its location. The symptom onset – in the timeline of the development of the tumor – depends in many cases on the nature of the tumor (as to it being benign or malignant), and in many cases is also related to the change in the nature of the neoplasm, from slow-growing, late-symptom-onset benign to faster-growing, early-symptom-onset malignant.
