Exocrine cancers[edit]
The exocrine group is dominated by pancreatic adenocarcinoma (variations of this name may add "invasive" and "ductal"), which is by far the most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers.[2] This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises - the pancreatic ductal epithelium - represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume.[18] This cancer originates in the ducts that carry certain hormones and enzymes away from the pancreas. About 60â€“70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the 'head' of the pancreas (see diagram, right).[2]

The next most common type, acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.
