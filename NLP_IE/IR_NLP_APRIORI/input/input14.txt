Risk factors[edit]
Main article: Risk factors of breast cancer
The primary risk factors for breast cancer are female sex and older age.[25] Other potential risk factors include: genetics,[26] lack of childbearing or lack of breastfeeding,[27] higher levels of certain hormones,[28][29] certain dietary patterns, and obesity. Recent studies have indicated that exposure to light pollution is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer.[30]

Lifestyle[edit]

Smoking tobacco appears to increase the risk of breast cancer, with the greater the amount smoked and the earlier in life that smoking began, the higher the risk.[31] In those who are long-term smokers, the risk is increased 35% to 50%.[31] A lack of physical activity has been linked to ~10% of cases.[32] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from breast cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[33]

There may be an association between use of oral contraceptives and the development of premenopausal breast cancer,[34] but whether oral contraceptives use may actually cause premenopausal breast cancer is a matter of debate. If there is indeed a link, the absolute effect is small.[35][36] In those with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, or who have a family history of breast cancer, use of modern oral contraceptives does not appear to affect the risk of breast cancer.[37][38]

The association between breast feeding and breast cancer has not been clearly determined; some studies have found support for an association while others have not.[39] In the 1980s, the abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posited that induced abortion increased the risk of developing breast cancer.[40] This hypothesis was the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, which concluded that neither miscarriages nor abortions are associated with a heightened risk for breast cancer.[41]

There is a relationship between diet and breast cancer, including an increased risk with a high fat diet,[42] alcohol intake,[43] and obesity,[44] related to higher cholesterol levels.[45] Dietary iodine deficiency may also play a role.[46]

Other risk factors include radiation,[47] and shift-work.[48] A number of chemicals have also been linked including: polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organic solvents[49] and a number of pesticides.[50] Although the radiation from mammography is a low dose, it is estimated that yearly screening from 40 to 80 years of age will cause approximately 225 cases of fatal breast cancer per million women screened.[51]

Genetics[edit]
Some genetic susceptibility may play a minor role in most cases.[52] Overall, however, genetics is believed to be the primary cause of 5–10% of all cases.[53] In those with zero, one or two affected relatives, the risk of breast cancer before the age of 80 is 7.8%, 13.3%, and 21.1% with a subsequent mortality from the disease of 2.3%, 4.2%, and 7.6% respectively.[54] In those with a first degree relative with the disease the risk of breast cancer between the age of 40 and 50 is double that of the general population.[55]

In less than 5% of cases, genetics plays a more significant role by causing a hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome.[52] This includes those who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation.[52] These mutations account for up to 90% of the total genetic influence with a risk of breast cancer of 60–80% in those affected.[53] Other significant mutations include: p53 (Li–Fraumeni syndrome), PTEN (Cowden syndrome), and STK11 (Peutz–Jeghers syndrome), CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1, and PALB2.[53] In 2012, researchers said that there are four genetically distinct types of the breast cancer and that in each type, hallmark genetic changes lead to many cancers.[56]

Medical conditions[edit]
Breast changes like atypical ductal hyperplasia[57] and lobular carcinoma in situ,[58][59][60] found in benign breast conditions such as fibrocystic breast changes, are correlated with an increased breast cancer risk. Diabetes mellitus might also increase the risk of breast cancer.[61]
