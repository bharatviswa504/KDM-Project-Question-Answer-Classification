Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40, and more than half of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70.[2] Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions.[2] About 25% of cases are linked to smoking,[5] and 5â€“10% are linked to inherited genes.[2] Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy).[5][6] The disease is divided into stages, from early (stage I) to late (stage IV).[3] Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.[7]

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat.[8] A smoker's chance of developing the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20 years.[4] Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure the disease; it may also be done to try to improve quality of life without the potential for cure.[9] Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed.[3] Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.[10][11]
