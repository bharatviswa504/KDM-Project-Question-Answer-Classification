Glioblastoma multiforme[edit]
Main article: Glioblastoma multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive (grade IV) and most common form of malignant brain tumor. Even when aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical excision is used, median survival is only 12â€“17 months. Standard therapy for glioblastoma multiforme consists of maximal surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy between two and four weeks after the surgical procedure to remove the cancer, then by chemotherapy. Most patients with glioblastoma take a corticosteroid, typically dexamethasone, during their illness to relieve symptoms. Experimental treatments include gamma knife radiosurgery,[29] boron neutron capture therapy and gene transfer.[30][31]

Oligodendrogliomas[edit]
Main article: Oligodendroglioma
Oligodendrogliomas are incurable but slowly progressive malignant brain tumors. They can be treated with surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination. For some suspected low-grade (grade II) tumors, only a course of watchful waiting and symptomatic therapy is opted for. These tumors show a high frequency of allelic co-deletions on the p and q arms of chromosome 1 (1p19q) and have been found to be especially chemosensitive with one report claiming them to be one of the most chemosensitive tumors.[32] A median survival of up to 16.7 years has been reported for grade II oligodendrogliomas.[33]
