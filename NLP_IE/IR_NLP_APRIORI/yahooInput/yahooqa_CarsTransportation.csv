what's the best bike for on-road exercise? thinking 45 to 60 min rides at a time (for starters).,"Finding the right bike for excercising is more about fit than anything else. Riding a bike that does not fit will cause pain and likely also knee and/or back problems. The for starters part indicates that you potentially want more, so I will recommend finding a good local shop that can measure you and find a bike of the correct size with the right angles for you. In my area I can recommend http://bicycleoutfitter.com/site/intro.cfm and http://www.cupertinobike.com/. Both are experts in finding and adjusting a bike just for you. Cupertinobike is perhaps a bit more for the hardcore riders. Please dont forget to buy a good pair of bike shorts. And for the saddle we are all different, but soft is not necessarily more comfy in the long run."
What is better to use a brush or a sponge? What are the pros and cons?,Sponges made for specifically for washing cars and non-stick cooking surfaces are good. I wouldn't use a brush unless it was made for washing cars.
"Hi, <br><br>I have some tree sap on my car, both older (pretty dry) and some newer from a redwood tree. <br><br>Any tips on how to remove it?",I have had good luck with commercial products available at auto supply stores for just a few dollars. Below are some additional suggestions if you want to try DIY:
"I want to go to san francisco from Palo Alto without a car, and I want to know if there is a ticket that can do this, in particular, one that would work for the whole day.","If you're going this route regularly, then Caltrain Monthly pass holders can purchase a Muni sticker along with their pass at all Caltrain ticket offices, Ticket Vending Machines and through the Ticket-by-Mail program. The Muni sticker isnâ€™t available with the 10-ride Ticket. The Muni sticker allows Caltrain passholders unlimited rides on all Muni services, except cable cars, for a monthly cost of $40, a $5 discount off the cost of a Muni Fast Pass.    If you're just looking for something for the day, then I would say take CalTrain from Palo Alto to the City and then get a 1 day Muni Passport ($9)"
Why hybrid cars gas mileage is better in city ?,"hybrid cars save energy in two ways:  1.by storing energy from the breaks 2.by engaging the gas motor only in it's most effective work RPM meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed (close to the most efficient motor RPM) Having said the above, driving in the city almost never gets you to the efficient RPM.  Also- it is true that the same energy that is being stored in the cars' battery needed to be generated by chemic energy. The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco, the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.  You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.  So- all in all- I the hybrid benefits are more visible in city driving"
"looking to know when i'd want longer runners vs shorter runners, etc.","Longer runners are better for high rpm power but you sacrifice power at the low end. Shorter runners give you more grunt at low rpm's but are less efficient at high rpm's. Many modern vehicles have variable intake runners to switch between short and long paths based on rpm. In the reference below, a white paper on Toyota's TVIS variable induction system (10-15 years old but you'll get the gist of it)"
what are the limitations for that kind of an istallation,"1. Physical compatibility- does the new engine work with the existing transmission? If not, is a transmission available that will fit the chassis? Does the increased weight of the engine require a new set of springs and shocks up front so as not to upset the handling balance?    2. Electrical compatibility- does the stock wiring harness and ECU work? If not, how much work to rip out the harness and put in a compatible one. Is a compatible harness available or does it need to be custom made (often this is a bigger obstacle than 1.)    3. Durability. If there is a 3.0L version of the car that you currently own, does it have different components to withstand the stress of the extra power? Specifically universal joints, driveshafts, and brakes.    Often it is easier and cheaper to sell your car and buy the 3.0L version of the car you own."
"Complicated question: Here goes. <br><br>I currently live in NYC (with wife and kids), and won't be moving out to California until December, even though I began working at Yahoo in April (I'm commuting every week x-country). <br><br>I say that as background because my 95 year old grandfather in New Haven, CT just decided to give me his old car (a 2002 Toyota of some kind). Until we move out to California, however, we're going to be parking it my wife's sister's in Stamford Connecticut. <br><br>So here's the question: Can I register the car now in California or do I have to wait until it has physically arrived in the state? <br><br>And if not, how much extra is it going to cost me to register now in New Haven and then to reregister it again in California? If the additional money is significant, we'll probably just wait until we come to California, because we have very little need to use the car until then. <br><br>Hope that all made sense.",i've done that recently. the car must be physically located in california. they needto inspect it and such.    btw - you have to do that a month or so after you get it in the state or you get a fine.
"I believe Cartalk said its ok, but they are just radio personalities....","While it is true that putting premium gas in a car designed for regular is a waste of money, the opposite is not true. Contrary to popular belief, premium gas has the same or even less energy than regular, the sole difference being the temperature at which it will ignite.     Many cars that require premium gas require it because their engines run at high temperatures and/or compression and regular gas will ignite prematurely causing detonation, which sounds like a knocking in the engine. Modern cars do have sensors which detect this condition and will dial back the power accordingly to prevent damage but the point is that the condition has to occur for the engine to respond.     In effect, a tiny amount of damage can occur every time to fill your car with regular gas. While putting regular in by accident once in a while is probably fine, the effect of the damage is cumulative and probably not worth the couple hundred you save every year. If you have a turbocharged car then you should NEVER put in regular gas. Ever. The same is true for high revving, high output Honda VTEC engines like the S2000 or Prelude.    PS- Cartalk also advised some listeners that the interior of their Honda Element was washable with a hose. Some poor listener did this and inflicted hundreds of dollars in damage to their car by soaking electronic components. Let the listener beware..."

How do I get a sticker off of a car window (plastic part)? Nail polish remover seems risky?,"Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue. Soak the area, and wipe it away. It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.    Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic. I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful.     In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape. Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly. Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it. This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective."
"...and of course the roads, as well...","Japan follows the British system of cars drive on the left side of the road.     in the 1850's Gunboat diplomacy forced the Japanese to open their ports to the British and Sir Rutherford Alcock, who was Queen Victoria's man in the Japanese court, persuaded them to adopt the keep left rule.     So just as in the US where you drive on the right, and the driver's seat is on the left for maximum visibility when making a left turn, most cars in Japan have the wheel on the right. Funny thing is, many foreign made cars in Japan (US, German, etc) keep the wheel on the left for a status symbol of hey, i'm so cool. I drive a foreign car. But of course, now prestige is accorded to Lexus & Acura cars as well...."
When is the second generation mini cooper coming out?,"It looks to me like we're going to have to wait another year at least for the 2007 MINI. I found this MINI-obsessed forum about the upgrades and newest features to be released with the next generation, and then true to form, Wikipedia was there to back it up. Best,  `k."
which one is better ? BMW or infinity G35?,"When comparing these two makes itâ€™s important to establish which two models and trim levels would be comparable. For this example I will use the Infiniti G35 Manual and the BMW 330xi (both 2006). First off is the pricing, where Infiniti beats the BMW in any configuration (eg, add-ons etc). From a drivers perspective the engine inside of the Infiniti is a very reliable and steady powerhouse with a slightly lower torque band than the BMW. Then again after driving both cars and driving BMW's for years I have to say now that I favor the BMW Inline 6 which is a pinnacle of automotive engineering. Its been retooled over the years but the engine is one of the most perfect machines that I have ever driven with gear ratios and compression that feel just right. The Infiniti manual tranny canâ€™t really be compared to a BMW, who has honed their 6 speed to a silky smooth or dynamic box. Its true that what you put in is what you get out in a BMW, because you can drive them hard or soft and the overall dynamic I wouldnâ€™t trade for an Infiniti, which has a noticeable difference in feel... its heavier but still a very capable machine. If you are auto sticking I still prefer the BMW Steptronic 6. In terms of comfort the 3 series has made a consistent effort to provide a very organic support to the drivers and passengers with the addition of the premium and sports packages. The Infiniti does have larger and more a more plush feel as well as a much more comprehensible navigation system. The inclusion of the rather complex iDrive system in BMW's has frustrated a lot of drivers including myself (although once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense, just very frustrating to start). The iPod integration in BMW's is still rather sketchy... you cant have that and certain components installed at the same time and ealier versions limited how many playlists and songs the stero system could actually recognize and play. Later versions are somewhat improved but the aftermarket additions by Alpine can be worth it if you are an avid user. In terms of over all feel the Infiniti has made more inroads this year in terms of creature comforts than BMW. I would suggest the addition of the premium package for improved audio quality in both vehicles. Already a nimble machine the addition of the Sport package for the BMW makes it a very satisfying experience for the driving enthusiast. I trust the xDrive system to provide more sure footing in all weather but I havenâ€™t had a chance to test the Infiniti in other than optimal conditions. The Infiniti is a very nice machine overall. Good dynamics and characteristics make it the best bang for the buck but personally I would suggest to splurge and go for the BMW, which, besides its wonderful performance and better care package provided in the Ownership benefits (BMW Maintenance Program), has better standing than the Infiniti."
"I would like to purchase a BMW, should I upgrade to the sports package?","The simple answer is if you have to ask, probably not :) The Sport Package offers more supportive seats and a more aggressive wheel and tire package and suspension. The upsides are better handling and appearance(highly subjective), but tires will be more expensive and the ride will be harsher. Test drive both and see which you prefer. On the other hand, sport package models are highly sought after but the increased resale value probably doesn't offset the cost of purchase, so if you get it, get it for yourself and not the next owner ;)"
Would there be an AMG version for the R Class?,Almost certainly. Mercedes has enjoyed great success with all of their AMG line so an R55 or R60 is not likely to be far down the road. It will also be extremely expensive seeing as how the relatively pedestrian R500 is already at the $70K mark.
Worst. Car. Ever. I'll never buy anything that's not Japanese again. Buy why are Volvos the suckiest of all cars?,"J.D. Powers report annually on initial quality and dependability. Every year the European and American nameplates close the gap with the Asian nameplates. In recent years the domestic nameplates have surpassed many of the Asians, both in initial quality and longer term vehicle dependability. Perception usually lags reality. Especially for products that purchased infrequently like an automobile. European vehicles still are behind with some of the worst being the luxury vehicles that come out of Europe."
"I have a rather large dent in my car and need a good auto repair man in the Sunnyvale area, any suggestions?",The cartalk show from NPR keeps a database of shops with recommendations called the MechanXFiles. Go to http://www.cartalk.com/ and input your zip code under the MechanXFiles logo.
Or is it mostly for styling?,"On the bug, the spoiler really serves two purposes: 1) Visually differentiates the turbo model in a low key way 2) By disrupting laminar flow over the roof of the car, reduces the lift (rather than increasing downforce) generated by bernoulli's principle. It also keeps water off the rear window. Joey is right in his assessment of most spoilers. You have to have a pretty big one to have any effect. My Evo's spoiler is a good example of a functional piece (it is homologated as a racing aero part). It's about a foot tall and has a flat airfoil. Even with a wing that size you don't really see an effect until around 60-70 mph, which is useful on a track but not really on the street. I make my spoiler useful by driving it on a track ;). Useful aero pieces on production cars usually take two forms, either a tiny lip on the trailing edge of a car (reduces drag and lift), or a giant wing (which should be flat, curved wings are not as effective), which increases downforce but also increases drag. The Beetle's spoiler is really more of a lip than a spoiler."
The car is on the verge of being out of warranty and looking for a shop to do minor service like oil changes and Inspection I/II and more involved repairs like swapping out radiators and hose replacements.,"Phil, I highly recommend D&M Motors in Palo Alto for Audi, Porsche, BMW. They are very honest and good, I've been going for years. they have helped me troubleshoot and fix some probs on my A4 that have confounded other mechanics, going the extra mile to do so. number is 1.650.329.9016."
Why does my BMW take only premium gasoline?,"BMW engines are designed to run at a high compression ratio. If you took chemistry in high school, you remember the ideal gas rule PV=nRT which essentially states that with increased pressure you get increased temperatures. So the cylinders in a bmw run hot. Premium gas ignites at a higher temperature, so it is compatible with the engine in your car.     Regular gas has the same amount of energy but will catch on fire prematurely in your cylinders causing knocking and pinging which is bad for your engine. If you put regular gas your car, it is smart enough to catch it but you will have less power. Also a tiny amount of damage can potentially happen each time you do this as the car will assume it's premium then dial back in response to the pinging. So I wouldn't do it for any extended period of time.    It is important to know that cars designed to run on regular gas do not benefit AT ALL from using premium, so don't bother."
How will the C230 2006 differ from the 2005 C230?,They will be minor if any. The 2005 model received a significant refreshing and it would not be cost effective to make major changes for 2006.
Is Lexus anticipating on releasing more models that run on electric / battery power & gasoline?,"Yes, the Lexus flagship is going to be available as a hybrid- the LS600h. However, like all Toyota hybrids except the prius, the hybrid technology is biased more towards performance than economy and has no special status with regards to driving in the HOV lanes. It will be at least $70K and be extremely fast but no more efficient than mid-high 20's."
"I've heard that some Subaru engines are very prone to head gasket failure. If I have bubbles in my coolant reservoir (so many that it overflows coolant -- even when it's not overfilled) does that mean I have a bad head gasket? Also, the temp gage started rising very quickly while in line at a toll booth... but dropped immediately when I upped the engine rpm to move forward (just a few feet and at low speed, so it wasn't airflow past the radiator). No white smoke from the tailpipe.","I think that may be a sign of a blown headgasket. I think if that might be the case the best thing to try is to check the oil to see if any coolant has gotten into it(I think its a brownish milky color if it has), and also maybe check the coolant to see if any oil has gotten into it. Other things you might check are. check under the car to see if coolant is leaking somewhere. It might just be a leak, check the hoses to see if they are wet. changing a hose is quite a bit cheaper than changing a headgasket. those are some things that are easy to do before going under the gun to replacing the headgasket."
What's the ugliest car on the road?,"The Pontiac Aztek. Cars like the Scion xB and Toyota Prius are polarizing cars but they sell in big numbers and hit their targets. The Aztek was frighteningly faithful to its concept vehicle and answered a question that no one asked: what would happen if we put a sloping rear window and regular doors on a minivan? Heads should have rolled at GM for that decision, the sales for the Aztek have been abysmal since its launch."
"I have a in-law who is thinking of getting a KIA Van (Sedonna??). I guess there is a deal if buy a brand new Sedonna (sp??), you get a new KIA Rio(sp??) free.","They are a good value and the Koreans have made amazing strides in the past few years. While the first Kias were rolling suicide booths, it looks like the Sedona actually does well in crash tests (see link). The Rio has also been updated for 2006, so if there really is a 2 for 1 deal, the 06 would not be bad. The 05 is pretty horrible though. Also, nothing is free so your friend can probably pick up a sedona without a crappy 2005 rio for even less."
Which Mercedes-Benzes are rare?,No current Mercedes is truly rare like the classics but the more rare models are-    AMG Models  V12 models (600 series)  Mercedes SLR ($400K) made by McLaren and AMG    Classic mercedes which are renowned as classics are    190SL convertible  300SL Gullwing  1936 500K    My personal favorite was the little known but well loved 190E 2.3-16 of 1986-1988. This was basically a little sports sedan tuned by Cosworth Racing. Not that fast by today's standards but a beautiful and sporty little car.
Are Lexus vehicles built locally or are they all imported?,"All Lexus vehicles are built in Japan, in a variety of facilities. Some are built in dedicated Lexus facilities while others share platform and lines with normal toyota models. The plant where a car is built should not be a significant factor in choosing a car."
Who are AMG's competitors?,"AMG's competitors are the BMW M series (m3, m5, m6) and audi's s series (s4, s6, s8, rs4, rs6, rs8). Also, Cadillac is coming up with some worthy competition with their V-Series. (sts-v, cts-v, xlr-v)    In general AMG tends to be more balanced on the comfort scale than BMW. They are brutally fast but also very easy to drive and comfortable. For instance all AMG vehicles are automatic transmission whereas all BMW's use either a manual or a sequential manual transmission. Audi is in between. S vehicles are available in both manual and auto versions. Cadillac tends to be more on the sport side as well."
Which company gives cheapest quotes for car insaurance ?,Progressive (800-776-4737) open 24/7 advertises that they will give you a quote for car insurance or refer you to another insurance company that will be cheaper. This may be worth a free call. I have had Progressive several years and they have been efficient and courteous. Their claims service was streamlined when my wife's car needed repair after someone hit it in a mall parking lot and drove away without leaving any ID. I believe their rates are relatively low. You can always get multiple quotes to check - but customer service counts too. Good luck.
Why is the shifter in a Prius like a joystick? and does it worsen the driving experience?,"The Prius has a CVT (continuously variable transmission) which does not employ normal gears. As a result, the shifter is just a switch and can take any form that the designers choose to implement. Additionally, since it is totally automatic and transparent in operation, it has a minimal impact on the driving experience as one rapidly grows accustomed to the controls and the driver doesn't interact with it except when putting it in park, drive, or reverse, not actions that occur more than a couple times each trip."
How many miles should I go before I need to get the oil changed?,"Since you drive a BMW, the car will tell you when to change the oil. Oil life is determined by a variety of factors including highway vs city mileage, temperature, average rpm, load factor, etc. The every 5000K miles recommendation from most car companies is a calculated guess but BMW's have a system that take these factors into account. So basically when the car tells you to do it, you should do it. You can even do it yourself, it only takes about 20 minutes of your time once you learn."
what is the best way to get a car door dent fixed?,"Depends on the size of the dent. If the dent is small (like the size of a half dollar) and there is no paint damage, the best option is paintless dent removal, do a search on the maps beta for paintless dent removal in your area and you can see where the shops are. (see link). PDR is much cheaper than normal methods, I've paid around $50/dent and been very satisfied with the results."
"What's a better car, a Camry or an Accord?","The Accord. Objectively the Accord just won the comparison test in the latest Car and Driver (camry came in last), and subjectively Honda is a much more innovative and interesting company than Toyota. For instance, the Accord has a racing derived double wishbone suspension at all four corners, resulting in a car with sharper handling than the camry. The Accord has also been mildly restyled for 2006, which in my opinion is a BIG improvement over the previous model. The gauges in the honda are electroluminiscent, which is immediately apparent when starting the car. The keys are RFID encoded to prevent theft. The navigation system is voice activated and one of the best on the market. THere really is no comparison between the two. Of course, drive them both, but the innovation is clearly with Honda in this comparison."
"In addition to the purchase price, how much for ongoing maintenance, etc?","Well , it is really depends on what is the size of it and what features you want it to have internally. The variety is huge, and so is the price range A new jet will be between 10 to 100 million, but an older one might be less then 10. So, in order to answer it- we need more details"
What is the average price for a BMW?,"it depends on which bimmer you want. new or used? these are new car prices. the following are the starting at prices for the different series bimmers and don't include any options and all those other charges you get stuck with.    3 series $30,900-$44,900  5 series $42,500-$57,400  6 series $71,800-$78,800  7 series $71,800-$118,900  X3 SAV $36,800  X5 SAV $42,500-$71,100  Z4 $34,800-$41,800  M series $48,900-$81,200 (doesn't include M6)"
Why should I purchase a Lexus over a Mercedes and BMW?,"The Lexus is a car for people who don't really like cars. They want cars to be comfortable, safe, cheap to own (particularly when you factor in depreciation), and high quality. In other words, if you view a car as an appliance and you just want it to do its job in as unobtrusive a way as possible, get the Lexus. They are trying to change this with their new models, but change comes slowly.    Mercedes-Benz cars are typically less luxurious and arguably built to a lower standard. They are filled with cutting-edge technology (Lexus is usually a couple years behind) and are quite enjoyable to drive, and are just as safe. They are also not quite as reliable, and they depreciate more quickly. Buy a Mercedes if you want luxury but also enjoy driving. If you really enjoy driving and don't mind a firmer ride, get a BMW."
is it a good idea to lease a car? dare to share experience?,"It is a fine idea to lease a car if: -Tend to switch cars every couple years -Drive a fairly consistent number of miles every year (which is under the limit) -You want to drive a car which is in demand and has a high resale value. -You have no interest in modifying your car Essentially, with a lease you are financing the depreciation of the car over the time you are driving it. For instance, for a 40K BMW, it may depreciate to around $28K after two years, so you finance the $12K difference. Since lease prices are tied to depreciation and not base price of a vehicle, you can afford a more expensive car than you would ordinarily be able to finance. Typically the best deals are through the finance arms of the manufacturers of the cars. Keep these facts in mind and you'll be fine."
"Which is better in terms of reliability and value for money, a C240 Sedan or C230 Coupe?","The C230 Coupe is a better value for money. The Coupe was launched in europe at a HIGHER price point than the sedan, but because hatchbacks do not sell well in europe, MB USA decided to price it lower in the US. If you don't need rear seats the coupe offers more cargo versatility as well as the skyview roof, which gives you many of the advantages of a convertible with the security of a fixed roof. The C230 Coupe also has every safety feature available on the C240 sedan.    The C240 has a 168 HP V6 engine which is fairly weak, particularly with the sedan. There are two C230 coupes. They both have around 190 hp, but the newer models have a 1.8L aluminum engine, whereas the older models have a 2.3L iron engine. Both are reliable, but the 1.8 is the newer model. The way you can tell is by looking at the trim behind the front wheel. The 2.3 has no badge there but the 1.8 says 1.8 on the rubstrip. The 1.8L is supposed to handle and drive better and was released in 2003 I believe."
Why is the Mini commonly called a Mini Cooper? Who is Cooper?,John Cooper was Alec Issigonis' friend and also a race car driver. They collaborated on making a sportier Mini which was then called the Mini Cooper. Interestingly the Mini Cooper is the base model here in the US (which is why all minis here are Coopers) but in europe there is a lower priced model just named the Mini One. As a result the phrase Mini Cooper is not interchangable with Mini in europe.

when should i change the tires of my car?,The link that was posted above says 2/32 of an inch of tread is when to change. This is absolutely correct and is the legal limit in some states. The easiest way to check is to do the Lincoln test with a penny. Take a penny and insert Lincoln's head into you tire tread where the tread is most worn. If you can see above Lincoln's head then you need a new tire. If his head is obscured by the tread then you are still ok.
Where did the name Mercedes Benz come from?,"Automobile manufacturers Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschat and Benz were competitors in Germany in the early 1900's. In 1926, the two companies merged.   A symbol was chosen for the combined products of DMG and Benz. The new insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed with laurel. The word Mercedes was at the top and the word Benz was at the bottom."
What is AMG and what does it stand for?,"Aufrecht Melcher Grossaspach, I answered your other question, but essentially it's Mercedes' sport designation. Similar to M cars for BMW or S cars for Audi."
Does the Fix-A-Flat product really work? Does it do any damage?,"It essentially destroys the inside of your tire in order to plug the hole, by chemically bonding with the rubber in the tire.. If you use Fix-A-Flat, basically you should count on buying a new tire instead of patching the hole. Also, since many forms of debris remain in the tire, fix-a-flat can trick you into thinking your tire is ok while there is a nail or something doing even more damage. Changing a tire is extremely simple to do and if you practice it once you'll be surprised at how easy it is."
When was the original Mini first launched? When did the new MINI launch?,"The original Mini was built in 1959, for the British Motorcar Corporation. Bear in mind that this predates the BMW acquisition of the brand from Rover in 1994 by many, many years. The new Mini launched in 2001 as a 2002 model. Interestingly the original mini was built all the way to 2000, making it one of the longest lived automotive desitns."
Why won't drivers use thier turn signals?,"Simple math: one hand on cell phone, other hand on coffee mug, right foot on gas pedal, left knee for steering. What do you want them to use to activate the turn signal?"
What does BMW stand for?,"BMW was originally (in 1917) the initials for Bayerische Motoren Werke, which means Bavarian Motor Works. These days, the corporation seems to be just called BMW Group. (They use this name even on the German language version of their web site.)    Incidentally, the way Germans pronounce BMW sounds something like bay-em-vay in English."
I was planning to buy a Ford Escape Hybrid and I was still debating if its worth to shell out extra 5000 dollars for getting the Hybrid option.. I dont remember the article where I read that when the Gas prices touch 9 dollar/Gallon then its worth buying a Hybrid.,"Currently, there is no financial justification for buying a hybrid vehicle based on fuel costs alone. In california, the tax credit and ability to drive in the HOV lane mitigate this somewhat, but unfortunately the Escape Hybrid is only eligible for the federal $2K tax deduction but not the california clean air tax credit. Click on the link below for an analysis from the WSJ's detroit bureau chief on his analysis of the cost benefits of owning a hybrid vehicle. Also included is an in-depth analysis from Omninerd that breaks it down for you. Essentially, you should do it for the feel good environmental reasons and not necessarily savings from fuel."
Is the MINI the smallest car in production?,The Smart car made by Daimler-Benz is the smallest car currently in production. It's exterior length is just under 2.5m ( 8ft 4ins ).
What makes AMG different from other Mercedes-Benz vehicles?,"AMG (Aufrecht Melcher Grossaspach) was the leading independent tuner of Mercedes-Benz automobiles when they were purchased by the company in the mid 1990's. AMG vehicles are meant to be the highest performing model for a specific model line (though not necessarily the most luxurious). They have handbuilt motors, upgraded brakes and suspension, and exclusive interior and exterior featuers. Since they are factory built they are covered by a manufacturer's warranty. They are also produced in relatively limited numbers. They can be identified by the badge on the trunk, as well as the two digit model designation. (i.e. C32 vs C320)"
Is one better than the other?,"Depends on the kind of driving you do. There are two types of hybrid systems, parallel and series. A parallel hybrid, like the Toyota and Ford systems, employs a separate electric motor and gas engine,connected in parallel to the wheels. Systems like these tend to be better for city driving, and this is usually reflected in the higher EPA city ratings for parallel hybrids. Parallel hybrids have, until very recently, been the only system that allows independent operation of the electric and gas motors, where the car can operate in pure electric mode at low speeds when the battery has a good charge. The Honda employs a series hybrid where the motor is integrated into the transmission and is connected in series to the drive wheels. These systems typically offer better highway mileage than parallel hybrids but slightly worse around town. Also typical with these systems is the inability to run the car in pure electric mode, though this has changed with the 2006 Civic Hybrid. While the Prius has been the state of the art in hybrid technology, it is my opinion that the new 2006 Civic Hybrid is the superior vehicle. It was designed from the ground up with the Prius as a benchmark, and the designers have hit their mark. I think the Civic will end up being a better driving experience. The platform was engineered to be the basis for the next generation of Honda vehicles, and the 2006 Civic Si, also based on the same platform, is considered to be the best in its class. The hybrid shares the same basic suspension as the Si, and will undoubtedly be compatible with the multitude of aftermarket suspension upgrades which will become available shortly for the 2006 civic."
