"When people yawn, you see that other people in the room yawn, too. Why is that?","When your body need more oxygen, you yawn.   When you yawn, you take more oxygen in the air.   If the density of the oxygen in the air becomes lower, other people (their bodies) can feel that and start to yawn to get more oxygen.  That's why yawns are contagious. Yawning is extremely contagious -- 55% of people who witness someone yawn will yawn within five minutes. If a visually impaired person hears a tape of someone yawning, he or she is likely to yawn as well. Face it, the likelihood of you making it to the end of this answer without looking like one of these gaping maws is unlikely.   Although the contagious nature of yawning is well established, we know less about why this is so. Researchers are currently giving the topic some serious attention. One theory suggests it's a holdover from a period in evolutionary history when yawning served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. A recent study postulates that contagious yawning could be part of the neural network involved in empathy.     While the mystery of contagious yawning has yet to be solved, perhaps researchers are closing in on an answer. On the other hand, given the subject matter, we wouldn't blame them for falling asleep at the wheel. In the meantime, give the yawn challenge a try -- it's tougher than it looks."
"Can someone help me with understanding someone else's wisdom, please? <br><br> It is very easy in the world to live by the opinion of the world. It is very easy in solitude to be self-centered. But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. ","That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay Self Reliance, which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm).     I think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them. It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the independence of solitude). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a finished man can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced perfect sweetness comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals.     What do you think?"
"When I was a kid I remember seeing a book that was like an yearbook of all newspapers published by the Times during WW II.

Which are the best K-12 public schools in the SF Bay area?,"it depends on what you're looking for.    Cupertino district has some of the best test scores, but the flavor of the classes and homework is very intense. creativity is not promoted, but instead repetitive training and exercises are encouraged. Some people find this stifling, but this district is VERY popular especially with people of asian origin.    Neighboring Saratoga has similar or better scores, but the corriculum encourages much more diversity and creativity.    Palo Alto has a mixture of very good and average schools, so it depends which ones you get in to. The flavor is generally similar to Saratoga, and maybe a tad less competitive.    Another district to consider is Los Altos, the main problem there is that the high school is not very good.    The attached URL will give you very good insight into the scores and quality of the schools as well as demographics, but unfortunately very little insight into the flavor of each."

Where is the world smallest volcano,"Taal volcano in the Philippines is considered to be the world's smallest active volcano. Its caldera is ~400 meters tall. It's also considered one of the world's most active volcanos, as it has erupted over 20 times in the past 400 years."
What is the history behind it?,"here is what the Net has to offer:    http://signalfan.freeservers.com/history.html    As early as the mid-1800's, the railroads in both England and the United States were using lanterns, hung from crossbars, to give railroad men a signal visible by night as well as by day. For the control or direction of street traffic by colored lights however, England appears to have led the way. The worlds first traffic signal using colored lights was installed in December of 1868 at the intersection of George and Bridge Streets near the Houses of Parliament. It had been installed in response to a suggestion by a select committee that railway signal gear be adapted to street traffic. It's purpose was to give protection to members of Parliament and lesser street crossers at a point where vehicle traffic was very heavy.      The resulting signal was invented by J.P. Knight, a railroad signaling engineer. Shown here by a surviving drawing, it was to have been an imposing 22' high and crowned with a gas light. The semaphore arms, when extended horizontally, meant Stop. When lowered to a droopy 45Â° angle, meant Caution. At night, a green light and red light were used in conjunction with the arms.    Although it is entirely possible and probable that other attempts were made to control traffic by colored lights after this London experience, no recorded account has come down to us until the earlier part of the 20th century..    you can also refer to:   http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2004/Projects/J0332.pdf#search='red%20is%20stop%20green%20is%20go%20history'"

How come fire trucks are red?,"Firetrucks are painted to be easily visible for safety reasons. Not all firetrucks are red and the decision on color is made at a local level. Many cities are beginning to use a bright yellow-lime color instead of red. Studies have shown that this is much more visible to a wide variety of people. Going to a fashionable, but not functional color like like black or gray would never happen for safety reasons."
I never took trig. Is it the level after calculus?,"In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.    In the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full AP Calculus, where the AP stands for Advanced Placement and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."

What is the history of seeing eye dogs?,"here is an article that I've found:Long before there was ever an established guide dog program was developed, dogs have been aiding the blind. A wooden plaque from the Middle Ages portrays a dog leading a blind man with a leash. The first actual attempt to train dogs to aid the blind was made in 1780 at Les Quinze-Vingts hospital for the blind, in Paris. In 1788, Josef Riesinger of Vienna was able to train a dog so well that people often doubted that he was blind!..."
"For colIege admission, is it better to take AP classes and get Bs or easy classes and get As?","I used to work in a college admissions office for a major university and they used a specific formula for calculating GPAs. They did this to put everyone on an even playing field - so that high schools that don't weight AP classes differently would be measured the same as those that do. Though I don't remember the specific calculation anymore, I definitely remember that AP classes were given a higher score. I'd suggest you take the AP class and try for the best grade you can get - because ultimately it'll be weighted higher at the college/university you are interested in, giving you a better chance of getting in!"
"If my high school grades are so-so, should I go to community college before a 4 year college?","Most state universities will have transfer agreements with local community colleges, so spending all four years in one place is not a prerequisite to earning your diploma there. Additionally, you may find that getting into general ed classes at some state universities is quite difficult, while the equivalent courses at a community college are plentiful and offered at more convenient times.     I know many people who have saved a lot of money and have been quite successful spending a couple of years in community college and then transferring to a four-year university. Good luck, whatever you decide!"
And what each oneâs specialty? Meaning â what area each one is famous in being the best among the Californiaâs College,"Best really depends on what you want. For example, UC Berkeley is generally considered the best public university because it is the most competitive and probably has the highest number of faculty with various honors such as Nobel Prizes. But if, for example, you're interested in veterinary medicine or oenology (science of winemaking), UC Davis is better. If you want a greater focus on undergraduate education, many students prefer UC Santa Cruz.    In addition to the other private universities that have been mentioned (Stanford, Caltech, and USC), there is a group of small private colleges called the Claremont consortium that is very highly rated. It includes Pomona College, Scripps College, and Harvey Mudd College. Each of these colleges has a special focus, but students in all of them get to share facilities and cross-register for classes."

The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. Quoted from the final chapter of Walden. Best,    `k."

Would it seriously affect my chances of getting into college if I don't have a high SAT score?,"Unfortunately, the answer is Maybe. If you are trying to get into a top tier school with very selective admissions, then a low SAT/ACT score is virutally a kiss of death. However, if you are looking at most state univerisities, then a low SAT/ACT score is not too bad. You may have to take a few remedial courses. MOST IMPORTANT!! A low SAT/ACT score WILL NOT stop you from going to college. And, in the long run, it really doesn't matter very much where you get your undergraduate degree (as long as the college/university is regionally accredited). For example, a degree in education from ANY regionally NCATE accredited school will get you hired as a teacher. An engineering degree from ANY ABET accredited school will get you hired as an engineer. Enjoy"
Should cell phones and PDAs be allowed in school?

What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree?,"One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE. In addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. In contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought."

What makes a teacher want to leave their profession?,"It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship. According to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. (Huling-Austin, 1986). These are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers: 1) Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline, difficulties with parents, and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials. 2) Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments. 3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching. Other factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies."
"How can teachers, parents and administrators improve test scores for middle school children?","I believe the best answer to your question is less obvious than what happens in the classroom or at home while children are in the process of learning. We (meaning the US) have gone a little bit overboard in trying to quantify academic progress, although some measurement is valuable. It's just been corrupted in recent years for political purposes to convince us we're making progress in how we stack up nationally. In any case, I'd suggest getting students at ease in the standardized test taking environment. Give them some experience before test days with time constraints and answer grids. For goodness sake, don't make a test seem like the whole future of the school district is dependent on their performance! Talk about test anxiety! Perhaps counselors have a role too in helping students who appear to be stressed by the experience with a few relaxation techniques. Your mind works like a file system, and the lower the stress, the more you are able to recall from the material that you actually do know."

How many words with 10 letters are there in the US dictionary?,"SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) has about 70,000 10-letter words total. If we limit it to the large subset recommended for spellchecking in the U.S., it's about 20,000 10-letter words. If we then remove proper names, capitalized words, abbreviations, contractions, and possessives, it's about 14,000 words (from abandoning to zygodactyl). Scrabble dictionaries usually have considerably fewer 10-letter words, because they remove words that can't be formed in normal gameplay. The one I have lists about 50 10-letter words."

Which part-time MBA program will add value to a software developer with 15 years experience?,"Wow. There are some pretty negative answers in this thread. Pick a good program. Pick a highly rated program. The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA, and frankly, the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper. Here in the Bay Area, Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings, recently been in the top 10 for full time). I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region. Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program. I agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it. Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student. I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student. It opens a lot of doors. But you need to be very goal directed to get this value. I can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good. As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now. Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks. So - to your actual question. If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously). Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program. But talk to people, figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA, and then go from there."

Should high schools offer classes on SAT for all?,"I'd say yes, all high schools should offer SAT test prep. The main two reasons: 1) Workers 18 and over with a bachelorâs degree earn an average of $51,206 a year, while those with a high school diploma earn $27,915. (U.S. Census Bureau). Basically, college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. This increased income provides more security, support to raise a family, and the means for furthering ones education. 2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree."

How would these courses improve overall teacher quality?,"Being an Master Educator myself, I would say that courses should be required that not only provide teachers-in-training a mastery of their content area, but also a better understanding of pedagogy, classroom management, and how to integrate technology into their classroom. I would also agree with the previous poster about ethics training. The content area knowledge would make them more knowledgable and therefore more capable of effectively communicating the important aspects of what they are teaching preferably in ways other than the standard lecture. Similarly, I am seeing that many new teachers are coming out with a less than ideal level of knowledge with regard to the pedagogical implications of their teaching techniques. By spending more time on how to effectively differentiate instruction and deliver exciting lessons, many new teachers would be ahead of the game. Additionally, classroom management is an important skill that is normally only taught (experientially) during field experiences. Knowing that this is generally an area of concern for new teachers more emphasis should be placed on it. Finally, integrating technology would help teachers to move away from standard textbooks, which while adequate, don't provide students the depth of knowledge they need to really understand the materials they are learning. The sum-total of all of these parts is a more well rounded teacher who is better prepared to engage students and enjoy a very rewarding career as a teacher."
What does buck naked mean?,"Dating from the 1920's the expression buck naked commonly means completely or totally naked or without a stitch (as opposed to partially naked). Synonyms include bare naked, buck-arse naked, and butt naked (also spelled, facetiously, butt nekkid). In the South, buck naked or butt naked means not in your house, out looking for trouble on Saturday night and wearing no clothes."
Do schools need better teachers or more funding? Why?,"Both, and neither. Schools need better support for their current teachers to help them become better. There's an over 50% turnover rate of new teachers in the first year. A little high, don't you think? A lot of it is about administrative and group support, new teachers a lot of times are thrown to the wolves. Better support a lot of times doesn't exist because the funding isn't there for teacher development, so it's a catch-22."
Any learning center that offers Personalized tutoring programs in Portland?,"The answer above is a great idea. Of course, this will only work if you don't mind non-person to person tutoring. I would contact your local high schools and see if there are any tutors that will tutor your kid. It might help both the high school student (elective credit) and your kid (because young kids look up to high school students). Newspapers are always advertising people looking for work such as nannies, care-takers, and yes...even tutors. I would try the high schools first.

Why is SAT important?,"Most colleges and universities use your SAT score as a factor in determining admissions. While it may be possible to get a waiver in some cases, your chances at consideration are much greater if you take the SAT.     Another reason to take the SAT is for financial aid consideration. Grants and scholarships, especially those run by the school or private organizations, often take SAT scores along with grade point average into account."
What do you call the 4-stringed Hawaiian instrument which looks like a little guitar?,"The ukulele, or uke, is a fretted string instrument. It's a smaller, four-stringed version of the guitar.

What are the Seven Sisters schools? Are they considered as good colleges?,"The seven sister schools are Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe and Barnard. Indeed, they are considered excellent colleges, I attended two of them myself!"
What can be done to lower the dropout rate in High Schools?,"To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention. In other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. Each learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. The NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student. One of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning. hope this helps!"
What is paraphrasing?,"Paraphrasing is when you put someone else's ideas in your own words. It's not just rewriting a paragraph or changing a few words. From the webs ite below: Paraphrasing is: *your own rendition of essential information and ideas expressed by someone else, presented in a new form. *one legitimate way (when accompanied by accurate documentation) to borrow from a source. *a more detailed restatement than a summary, which focuses concisely on a single main idea. Be careful about taking a sentence and only changing a few words in it--some plagarism detecting software will catch that and call it plagarism."

How can we improve the quality of the teachers in high schools?,"hi, This question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. There are several areas to focus on improving teachers: 1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS. 2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers. 3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements. 4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff. 5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important. hope this helps?"
Can someone tell me what break a leg means?,"It's a traditional way to wish actors good luck before a performance. Theatrical superstition has it that it's bad luck to wish someone good luck in a play, so instead, you say something with the opposite meaning. However, there are some alternative theories about the origin of this saying -- see reference below."

How can we make teaching more attractive to young people?,"Higher salaries- for the amount of education that a teacher has to have, their pay is a pittance. What other careers do you know where people with a master's degree in their chosen field start out around $35,000/ year, or less? The pay level is ridiculous- so low that teachers usually can not live on their salaries unless they are married to someone else who works, or have a second job. Second, reduce the workload. Most don't realize that a teacher's workday is not limited to 8 hours or so they are at school. When you add in the lesson planning and grading that must be done on your own time, the constant parent conferences, meetings, paperwork and evaluations, and training sessions that they throw at you, you're normally working the equivalent of 10-12 hour days, and filling up your entire weekends with it. Then add in more trainings and classes that they require you to take during your vacation times, and there's practically no break. Third- allow them to teach!! So much of the time is taken up with madated tests, evaluations, and forced mucky muck that teaching doesn't get to happen anywhere near as often as it should. And lastly- give teachers a break! Literally. Breaks are few and far between and dreadful are the times when you have to go and can't because there is no one else to watch your class. In short, teachers need help in a lot of ways."
