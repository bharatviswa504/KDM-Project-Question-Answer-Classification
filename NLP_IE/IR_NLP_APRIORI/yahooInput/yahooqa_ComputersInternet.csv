or even on some surfaces?,"Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse. The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.     Since glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly."
What are the pros and cons for web developers when using CSS,"PRO: CSS is designed to allow the separation of presentation and structure. Font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes are moved into a stylesheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML code. The HTML documents become much smaller and web browsers will usually cache sites' CSS stylesheets. This leads to a reduction in network traffic and noticeably quicker page downloads.    CON:   Naming can get confusing. For example, authors might associate the class name with desired presentational attributes; for example, a CSS class to be applied to emphasized text might be named bigred, implying that it is rendered in a large red font. While such a choice of naming may be intuitive to the document author, it can cause problems if the author later decides that the emphasized text should instead be green; the author is left with a CSS class called bigred that describes something that is green.     There are bugs in CSS that you need to work out when you need it to work across multiple browsers & platforms, and its harder to debug than with a simple HTML."
what is the best photo slideshow creation application,"I recently tried two products to create an end-of-the-season slideshow for my childrens swim team, MyDVD 6.1 from Sonic Solution and PictureShow 3 from ULead.    The first product, MyDVD 6.1 was easy to use, but had an unacceptable flaw and was missing a really great feature. When creating long slideshows (>99 slides), the software automatically created chapter points. The problem was, that the audio would drop out at each chapter, creating unpleasant silence at seemingly random intervals in the show (~4-5x during my slide show). Since their customer support had no recommendations on solving the problem, I was forced to look elsewhere.    The second product PictureShow 3 from Ulead, not only solved that problem, but added a feature that I really think is a must have. The feature, known as the Ken Burns effect, subtly zooms or pans the photo within the frame during playback. This allows a slide show to have a sense of motion. Everyone that viewed the DVD I created universally liked the effect and commented on the cool factor.    The UI for adding multiple audio tracks could be improved, but it does allow frame level control over positioning the audio. The DVD burning process on a large number of 8MP photos took about an hour for 260 photos, which was longer than MyDVD took for a similar task. The project templates and menu backgrounds provided for both products were a bit weak for my taste, so I used a custom background for my main menu.    All-in-all PictureShow 3 did a great job for me. The slide show was a great success and the audience of ~200-300 people who viewed it at the end of the season were impressed by the quality and I got numerous positive comments."
I have very small stuff stuck under my keyboard and it prevents it to from working. What will be the be st way to clean it?,"There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning.     After turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles.     Use the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys.     Dampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys.     Use the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris.   If you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse.     Of course, if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task, you can always buy a new one for around $20."
What is the single most important thing you are missing on the internet ?,"I think that the best thing about the internet is that you CAN be anonymous. I agree that there should be a single identity that a user can use in secured web sites, like banks, but I prefer it to be an identity specific to the category and not to the entire internet. Meaning, if you look at the FICO number and what affect it (being late in the supermarket affect you car insurance) I rather not repeat that in the internet world. So my suggestion is to have separate identity to separate categories – the Banks’ web site will have their own identity database and it will be a different one form the gambling industry, etc."

Gabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition."
i don't use floppies any more and need to boot from something other than my hard disk,"Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD. If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.    Note: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.    If you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you. There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.    If you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ . This process is not very straightforward though.    If you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS. For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want. For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs."

How do I reset the root password in Linux?,"Here's how to do it.  I would have had to dig up the CD's (who knows where they are) and do a recovery that way, or download something from Tom's Root and Boot Site. I had access to the Grub loader, so I had it easy.    If you've lost your root password, you might be able to recover it this way. However, some systems are protected with boot loader passwords that won't let you do that without THAT password. If the boot loader is password protected, you need to boot from other media - for newer systems, the install CD probably has the recovery tools for that (linux rescue for example).    But let's try it the easy way first. The first thing to try is to boot to single user mode. This MIGHT not work for you, because your system might be configured to still ask for a root password to get to single user mode. If that's the case, we'll use another trick that replaces init with /bin/bash.    First, try single user. If you don't see either a LILO or GRUB boot screen, try hitting CTRL-X to get one. If it's LILO, just type linux single and that should do it (assuming that linux is the lilo label). If GRUB, hit 'e, then select the kernel line, hit e again, and add single (or just 1) to the end of the line. Press ENTER, and then b to boot. (More modern grub uses a to append to the boot line)    You should get a fairly normal looking boot sequence except that it terminates a little early at a bash prompt. If you get a Give root password for system maintenance, this isn't going to work, so see the init version below.    If you do get the prompt, the / filesystem may not be mounted rw (although mount may say it is). Do    mount -o remount,rw /  If that doesn't work (it might not), just type mount to find out where / is mounted. Let's say it is on /dev/sda2. You'd then type:    mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda2  If you can do this, just type passwd once you are in and change it to whatever you like. Or just edit /etc/shadow to remove the password field: move to just beyond the first : and remove everything up to the next :. With vi, that would be /: to move to the first :, space bar once, then d/: and ENTER. You'll get a warning about changing a read-only file; that's normal. Before you do this, /etc/shadow might look like:    root:$1$8NFmV6tr$rT.INHxDBWn1VvU5gjGzi/:12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543  bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  and after, the first few lines should be:    root::12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543  bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::  You'll need to force the write: with vi, :wq!. (If that still doesn't work, you needed to do the -o remount,rw, see above).    Another trick is to add init=/bin/bash (LILO linux init=/bin/bash or add it to the Grub kernel line). This will dump you to a bash prompt much earlier than single user mode, and a lot less has been initialized, mounted, etc. You'll definitely need the -o remount,rw here. Also note that other filesystems aren't mounted at all, so you may need to mount them manually if you need them. Look in /etc/fstab for the device names.    Keep this in mind if you have a Linux machine in a publically accessible place : without more protection, it's not usually hard to recover a lost root password, which means it's just as easy for someone to CHANGE it, or access root without your knowlege.    Another way to do this is to remove the password from /etc/shadow. Just in case you screw up, I'd copy it somewhere safe first. You wan"

"i've been using tags in products such as delicious, my web 2.0, and flickr...but how do i explain the significance of tagging to somebody like my mom? what does it all mean?","Tags are like post-it notes that readers of the content leave behind for other readers.

You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes. Now imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular post-its thanks to an index of all of them. This is where the real power of tagging lies-- in the weight and meaning these agreed-upon notes give. Of course, context is everything. Next time you're together, show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent, most popular, most frequently used tags. I find my parents only get these new paradigms when I show them to them in context."

"If I choose to open an email attachment, will it be saved on my hard drive too?","Probably, but it can vary depending on which e-mail software you're using. Most of the time, desktop e-mail clients (as opposed to web mail services like Yahoo! Mail) will download the entire message -- including attachments -- to your hard drive before you ever see it. Then if you delete the message, it (usually) goes away. If you choose to open the attachment, you're often given a choice of whether to save it or just open it -- but even just opening it means it's been saved somewhere, usually a temporary cache. Sometimes, though, those temporary caches stick around for a long time. With web mail services, you do have to download the attachment before viewing it -- though in that case, your browser will probably put it in the same kind of temporary cache unless you choose to save it somewhere."
What is programming?,"Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. The role of a programming language can be described in two ways: 1. Technical: It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks 2. Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. According to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things: * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. According to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,]) ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this: primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units.'' A programming lanugage should both provide means to describe primitive data and procedures and means to combine and abstract those into more complex ones. The distinction between data and procedures is not that clear cut. In many programming languages, procedures can be passed as data (to be applied to ``real'' data) and sometimes processed like ``ordinary'' data. Conversely ``ordinary'' data can be turned into procedures by an evaluation mechanism."
what is the max file size on UNIX?,"It depends on which Unix you're talking about, and which filesystem you're using. For instance, some flavors of Linux have a 2GiB max filesize, unless the various programs are compiled with special options. The BSDs, on the other hand, can (mostly) deal with TiB sized files gracefully - except some programs (still) assume that you only can have a maximum size of 2 GiB. So, in short - 2GiB is the least-common-denominator of 'max file size', but most modern Unices can deal with bigger. At least some of the time. :)"
Appeal to their ego? wallets? sense of belonging? or something else?,"I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn incentivizes people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased. See my answer to the question, Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767 On the issue of the term incentivize--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process. To attempt to use softer language to describe something that is inherently cold, calculating, and opportunistic (though not necessarily bad or wrong) would constitute euphemism, and would be both misleading and dangerous."
I need to get a wireless card for my laptop. Are all cards compatible with all laptops? Which one is best?,"Q: Are all cards compatible? A: Not quite. If your laptop is a Mac Powerbook or iBook, you should get a USB wireless network adapter. And regardless if it's a Windows or Mac laptop, it's a good idea to double-check that it doesn't already have wireless capability built-in (most do nowadays). Assuming your laptop runs Windows, doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter, and is a relatively recent model (a Pentium II or newer CPU is a good hint), then just about any wireless card will work and you skip the rest of this explanation. If your laptop is more than 7 or 8 years old, you need to make sure it supports CardBus PCMCIA cards. Many wireless PCMCIA cards use the CardBus interface - it provides higher performance than the standard PCMCIA interface. Unfortunately, CardBus slots look just like a regular PCMCIA slot, so you can't tell if your laptop supports them just by looking. You can, however, easily tell if a wireless PCMCIA card uses CardBus or not. If it has a gold strip on top the end that goes into the PCMCIA slot, then it's a CardBus PCMCIA card. Many manufacturers of wireless PCMCIA cards offer them using both interfaces. Here's an example of a Siemens card (along with pictures that clearly show the difference between a regular PCMCIA card and CardBus card): http://kb.efficient.com/display/1n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=45947&r=0.1037256 Q: Which one is best? A: It depends on what your wireless network supports. But, in general, there are several good options and at very reasonable prices. WARNING: If you want to buy a wireless card to use at work though, you MUST check with your IT department before buying anything. First, they should really provide a wireless card - you shouldn't have to buy one. Second, businesses often configure their wireless networks to use specific security features, and you want to make sure you buy equipment that will be compatible. OK, assuming you want to use this for wireless connectivity at home, then just about any wireless card that supports 802.11g (aka Wireless-G) will suffice. I say that because most equipment for wireless home networks sold today uses the 802.11g standard. And anything that you buy nowadays will provide more than adequate security and encryption options. Choice of brand matters a lot, though I can't recommend a single one because you really want to get the same brand as the rest of your wireless networking equipment. For instance, if you have a Linksys wireless router at home, then get a Linksys wireless card. Technically, most of the wireless equipment is compatible with each other (I won't get into the gory details of why that's not always true), but if you get equipment from the same brand, then you know it's been tested by the manufacturer to be compatible. And the software you use to setup the various pieces of equipment will be very similar and use the same descriptions for various options - that should make things less confusing. If you're buying the other networking equipment too (e.g. the wireless router), then I recommend Linksys. I've never been disappointed by their products - good performance, reliability, support and at very good prices to boot. And you can find their products in almost any major retail store that carries computer products (like Best Buy). Hope this helps!"

Folksonomies are often implemented using tags. An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in."
Are Wireless Networks Secure?,"Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or snoop the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or inject unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough? Wireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots. Network engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment. Overall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now secure enough to use in the vast majority of homes, and many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or encrypt network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients. Obviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!"

CGI specifies a standard for passing data between the client and the program. An aim of CGI is to be language-neutral, though Perl is often associated with it."
what is a double layer DVD burner?,Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data. This is because they are pressed (as opposed to burned) dual-layer DVDs (also called DVD-9). The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes. This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD. Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably. So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd#Technical_information
"First it's the one-click stuff, and now it's consumer reviews. Do they have a legal leg to stand on?","Amazon, like other companies, tries to patent its innovations for two reasons: 1. To gain a competitive advantage by excluding competitors from using its new ideas. For example, Amazon once sued Barnes and Noble over a patent. 2. To discourage competitors from filing patent infringement suits against Amazon. This concept is sometimes called Mutually Assured Destruction. The idea that Amazon or other companies are patenting existing or obvious ideas is incorrect. It's an urban legend fueled by people's unwillingness to read and understand the patents. The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) only grants patents on techniques that are *novel* and *non-obvious*. You can look up any granted US patent on the USPTO website, and roughly evaluate it by reading the broadest independent claim, which is usually claim #1. Remember, to infringe the claim, you have to have all the elements of the claim. Generally, the claims are narrower (less powerful) than people think. Do they have a legal leg to stand on? Once a patent is gratned by the USPTO, it has roughly a 50% chance of being upheld if brought to court."
What does .com stand for?,.com stands for commercial. This is used by commercial websites but anyone can buy a domain name that ends in .com even if it is not going to be used commercially.
What is Visual Basic?,"Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click). The language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop. In 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel."
It seems to mean different things and different technologies to different people.,"The best article I've read on the subject is in the link below. In summary, the article cites the following 7 factors common to Web 2.0: * Services, not packaged software, with cost-effective scalability * Control over unique, hard-to-recreate data sources that get richer as more people use them * Trusting users as co-developers * Harnessing collective intelligence * Leveraging the long tail through customer self-service * Software above the level of a single device * Lightweight user interfaces, development models, AND business models"
What is a blog?,"There are several types of blogs, or Web logs. They have outgrown their old description of an online diary and have become a new way for citizen publishers to share opinions and information.    There are commercial blogs, like Captain Morgan's Rum's Captain's Blog which mainly serves to market a product.  There are political blogs, which gained prominence in the last election for scooping traditional news sources on some stories.  There are technology blogs, which alert developers and consumers to emerging trends and products.   You can find a blog on any subject under the sun, from new parents gushing over their offspring to serious commentary about world events.     To discover new and interesting blog content, I recommend Technorati and Feedster."

why do people talk about google as evil (or not evil)? Where does this relationship come from?,"Their motto is Don't be evil, in response to Microsoft's reputation as The Evil Empire."
I'm concerned that upgrading via a PCI card will not be any better. Any advice would be appreciated.,"Most onboard video for PC desktop motherboards are far short of performance for even a PCI-only card. For the Intel 845 chipset, having a dedicated PCI video card can definitely improve your performance, especially for 3D games."
dhcp server from where my interface got the lease on Linux.,There are a number of different DHCP clients that run on Linux. Use the command ps ax to try to determine what processes are running that might have something to do with your ethernet interface. DHCPCD is a popular one. Look to /etc/dhcpc for any files that might be there. PUMP is also a frequent program in use by some versions of RedHat Linux. Run pump -i eth0 --status assuming your ethernet interface is eth0 DHCLIENT -- run locate dhclient.leases and look into that file if you see that process running.
"I've used Adium/Fire on Macintosh Trillian on Windows Is there any software that runs on Mac, Windows AND Linux that can provide encrypted Yahoo/AIM chat? Skype is its own network, and not AIM/Yahoo.","The easiest way to have an encrypted conversation between any platform is probably to use a jabber server that supports SSL. jabber.org supports SSL, and clients are freely available for every platform. Adium for Mac is a good client, Gaim for Linux, and Gaim or Trillian for Windows should cover most of your needs using that combination."
What is the purpose of a web host?,"From wikipeadia: Web hosting is a service that provides individuals, organizations and users with online systems for storing information, images, video, or any content accessible via the Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server they own for use by their clients as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center. Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for servers they do not own to be located in their data center."

Can I view everything on the Internet via the wireless network?,Yes...you can :)
what is the most popular programming laguage in use today?,"This is a tough one, and no doubt a potential debate point in most cases. I would really doubt that C# has any real future. Java, on the other hand, is written in C. Most modern development platforms have a foundation in C. If this question is to choose a language path for school, I think either Java or C is fine. Though I would say that you will become a better programmer if you have a more detailed understanding of what is under the hood. In that case C (and a bit of assembly isn't bad to at least take a look at). The more higher-level you go, the less you can ultimately do."
how long will it take for someone to answer this question?,2 minutes.
Web 1.0 was about doing anything on the web. Web 2.0 is about community. What will 3.0 be?,"Web 3.0 will be like more of social networks and interconnected technologies. Like Google and Yahoo are starting click-to-call services. Web 3.0 is more likely to be a mix of technologies like web2.o, VoIP, social networking, blogging, mobile, syncing mobile(wap) with the web.. Like a consumer shopping on eBay can click on call button to directly bargain with the seller if he is online (making use of VoIP) and with eBays acquisition of Skype this is most likely to happen"
I tried configuring and setting up my wirelesss router which I bought from CompUSA but it won't let me get online even though it detects my IP address and shows a strong wireless connection. What could be the problem?,"Few things to look for: 1. Do you have cable or dsl or dial connection? 2. Earlier when you did not have the router, were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? If so, you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password. For SBC DSL modem you can do it by http://192.168.1.0/ and there is a option available in advanced configuration to do that. 3. Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to the WAN port of the router? 4. Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? Check it by Start->Run->Cmd->ipconfig. It should show you some IP address like 192.168.1.x. 5. Run the following command in the command window (start->Run->cmd) ping www.yahoo.com Hope this helps."
The Microsoft Help section is pitiful!,First load the add-in: Tools > Add-Ins > Analysis Tool Pack then find it: Tools > Data Analysis & Choose Regression If you need any more help mail me.
Should both computers use the same OS to share my DSL?,"DSL usually requires PPPoE connections. Most consumer routers will provide this functionality for you. Simply enter your username and password into the router and it will maintain a persistent connection for you. Then, each computer on your network can simply obtain a DHCP address from the router and use the Internet without any special software. Windows, Linux, MacOS, and other operating systems should be compatible with little or no configuration."
what is the best podcast to subscribe to?,"This Week in Tech is a great podcast. It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week, usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak. It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week. It's been the top podcast for some time now, probably because of the well known, intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality. Browsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in."
