Why did the U.S Invade Iraq ?,"A small group of politicians believed strongly that the fact that Saddam Hussien remained in power after the first Gulf War was a signal of weakness to the rest of the world, one that invited attacks and terrorism. Shortly after taking power with George Bush in 2000 and after the attack on 9/11, they were able to use the terrorist attacks to justify war with Iraq on this basis and exaggerated threats of the development of weapons of mass destruction. The military strength of the U.S. and the brutality of Saddam's regime led them to imagine that the military and political victory would be relatively easy."
What is the cause of the recent riots in Paris?,"Two muslim youths were electrocuted in a power substation while hiding allegedly because they were being pursued by the police. The police have denied this claim. Their deaths led the immigrant population to start rioting. Reasons cited were that immigrant youths don't feel integrated into French society, and feel marginalized by politicians who refer to them as thugs."
Who is Scooter Libby and what did he do?,Lewis Libby was the top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. He is under indictment for obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury about his involvement in leaking the name of an undercover CIA operative named Valerie Plame Wilson. Many believe this leak was in retaliation for her husband Joe Wilson's criticism of the use of faulty intelligence for entering the Iraq war.
Why won't George Bush meet with Cindy Sheehan?,"Because he is not aware of the responsibilities of being the President of the US. Bush has made a long history of ignoring the obvious for his own personal gain and arrogance. When things get bad, he has historically veered away from dealing weith things and people responsibly and run home to hide under his extravagant bed. Last time the walls were caving he 'found' Jesus. But Cindy is far too complex for his thought patterns to deal with. He'll meet with Tom, wacko preachers, torturing dictators, but cannot open his presidential door to a citizen and a taxpayer."
"North Korea has claimed the ability to build nuclear weapons, and has already demonstrated the ability to build rockets capable of reaching all of China's major population centers. Is China concerned about having another nuclear-powered neighbor? Western observers have questioned the reliability and sanity of the North Korean government. How does China view the trustworthiness of North Korea? Does China view North Korea as a potential threat to its security?","China is more concerned with threat from US or Japan than North Korea. Besides, both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapon already and are close to China as well. But it's hardly a big concern for China people."
What will the gun ban in the city accomplish? Will crime rate in San Francisco drop?,"The gun ban meassure makes it illegal to posses or sell firearms and ammunition anywhere in the city of San Francisco. The National Rifle Association has sued to overturn this ban. When a similar ban passed in 1982, the NRA sued and succesfully overturned the ban.    As for crime rate, it is hard to predict. A common argument made by right wing gun supporters says, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will sell guns. And Michael Moore, a prominent left wing activist and film maker, concluded in his film Bowling for Columbine that it is not necessarily the guns that make American culture violent (he points to how Canadians have even greater access to firearms, yet their crime rate is significantly lower).     Anti-gun arguments include: *Citizens have no need to own guns to protect themselves against crime because government is tasked with that obligation. *Guns, being devices implicitly designed to kill, raise the level of violence in any disagreement between people. *Guns are more dangerous to the owners than to intended targets because most gun related deaths are a result of domestic violence, accidents, and suicides.    According to the third link below, when D.C. banned firearms in 1976, the murder rate increased:    Crime has risen significantly since the gun ban went into effect. In the five years before Washington's ban in 1976, the murder rate fell from 37 to 27 per 100,000. In the five years after it went into effect, the murder rate rose back up to 35. In fact, the murder rate after 1976 has never fallen back to what it was in 1976. Robberies and overall violent crime changed just as dramatically.    But obviously in the real world there are many variables that affect the crime rate. So it is hard to truly measure what kind of impact a gun ban has on crime rate since you cannot isolate it from all of the other variables."
"With the USA having been the 4th country I have lived in, I am curious as to why the media/government wants to keep the general populous so inwardly focused. You find very little mention of things/events around the rest of the world in the main-stream media here. What's your take on this issue?","A large part of the America-centric focus of the American media is as a result of its structure. Let me explain: the American media is more privatized than any other media system in the world. Take the BBC, for example, it is a government-sponsored media outlet (rather than commercially sponsored) and it was conceived as a tool to educate the public. The American media -- first print, then radio, then television -- evolved as a system that is primarily supported by the money advertisers pay broadcasters for ad space. Advertisers are interested in at least two things: 1) the largest audience share (they race to capture the median viewer); and 2) a lack of controversy out of fear that their brand image might suffer in the mind of the public. This is part of the reason why the media pick domestic topics and focus on high-profile domestic personages (less controversy, and more relevant to the daily lives of Americans, so thus, more watched). Another reason has to do with the news cycle of the American media. In many countries, the news is still a half-hour, hour, or couple hours per day. In the U.S. with cable news, the news cycle is now 24-hours. This constant pressure to always be turning out stories gives journalists incentives to make their story production as efficient as possible. In practice, this means developing a set of official contacts that they can rely upon for sound bites that relate to their reporting areas. They build trust with these contacts and can count upon them to respond quickly. With major news bureaus tending to be on the east coast of the U.S., it is easier for journalists to develop ongoing relationships with officials who don't live at great geographic distances (even with the Internet, I'd argue). Also, with the rise in prominence of public relations firm (firms that specialize in creating news-worthy promotional material that frames their organizational or individual clients in a favorable light), information about celebrities and American personages is readily available and pre-processed for journalists to be newsworthy, and thus, such material is exceptionally appealing to journalists who by and large are ALL on a very tight deadline. Some communications researchers in the past have argued that -- with the exception of the elite -- most everyone in all countries would be interested in more gossip, lifestyle, and entertainment news. What stops some countries from providing it is either an authoritarian regime, or perhaps the more benevolent goal of providing an educational service. If you're really interested in this topic, I suggest a couple of interesting books: *The Creation of the Media* by Paul Starr, and *Deciding What's News* by Herbert J. Gans, both of whom are scholars of great repute."
There are a lot of proposals out there-- from just scrapping the whole city to turning it into a floating canal city like Venice. What should happen to New Orleans?,"It should be rebuilt of course,,, but the question is where and how? It should be rebuilt in a way to protect the city from future disasters. Possibly keeping the historic parts of the city as much as possible as a historical or tourist attraction and moving the other vulnerable parts of the city to safer locations."
"Tremas (diaeresis) are normally used to indicate that the (second) vowel is pronounced in a separate syllable, which indeed makes sense in coöperation, however, The New Yorker seems to be the only publication in the English speaking world which does so? Why? Are there other publishers?","It seems to be a stylistic holdover from an era when that usage was more prevalent (about the 1930s/1940s). The New Yorker has a highly entrenched writing style that has been rigorously enforced over the years. (For example, there was a staff Grammarian who overlooked much of the copy editing for over fifty years; see the below article for details.) In short, the writing style/voice has become as much a trademark of the magazine as its cartoons, and will most likely not be changing much in the foreseeable future."
Are we safe from terrorist attacks? Is the homeland security effective?,"It all depends on your definition of safe. For example, if you consider yourself safe when you are driving down the road, then you are also safe from terrorist attacks. About 40,000 people die in the U.S. yearly from car accidents. As far as airline security goes, two things which have been done have made the airlines more secure: 1. Securing the cockpit with stronger doors and restrictions on opening them 2. The knowledge of airline crew and passengers that they should fight back against hijackers rather than letting them control the plane."
Who the heck is the Dalai Lama?,"The Dalai Lama is a spiritual and secular ruler of some Buddhists in Tibet (and around the ruler). There are other lamas -- leaders of other followers who belong to other sects of Tibetan Buhhism. Tenzin Gyatso (Tibetan: བསྟན་འཛིན་རྒྱ་མཚོ་ Wylie: Bstan 'dzin Rgya mtsho) (b. July 6, 1935) is the fourteenth and current Dalai Lama. The fifth of nine children of a farming family in the Tibetan province of Amdo, he was proclaimed the tulku (reincarnation) of the thirteenth Dalai Lama at the age of three. On November 17, 1950, at the age of fifteen, he was enthroned as Tibet's Head of State and most important political ruler, while Tibet faced occupation by the forces of the People's Republic of China. After the collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement in 1959, Tenzin Gyatso fled to India, where he was active in establishing the government of Tibet in exile and preserving Tibetan culture and education among the thousands of refugees who accompanied him. A charismatic figure and noted public speaker, Tenzin Gyatso is the first Dalai Lama to travel to the West, where he has helped to spread Buddhism and to publicise the cause of Free Tibet. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In Tibetan Buddhism, the successive Dalai Lamas (taa-la'i bla-ma) form a tulku lineage of Gelugpa leaders which trace back to 1391. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the present incarnation of Avalokitesvara (Chenrezig [spyan ras gzigs] in Tibetan), the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government, controlling a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lamas never had authority over every region of Tibet nor over the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism. The current Dalai Lama (the 14th) is a respected Tibetan Buddhist religious leader and figurehead of the International Tibet Independence Movement; in English, he is often granted the style His Holiness (or HH) before his title."
