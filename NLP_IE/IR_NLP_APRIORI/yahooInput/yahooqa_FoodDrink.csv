What's the best way to heat up a cold hamburger (In & Out)?,"If you must eat a heated In & Out hamburger then I suggest the follow:  First, scrape the ketchup, mayo and any other sauce that is on the hamburger and put it a side. Also take the vegetables out.  Second, pre-heat a steak pan; put the hamburger separate form the bun on the hot pan  Third, heat up both parts of the bun near the hamburger on the same hot pan (you can get some souce from the hamburger on it)  Fourth, you can either put back the original ketchup, mayo and the vegetables or, better yet, get new ones from what you have at home .

recently in the market for a bbq. curious as to the pros and cons of using gas vs charcoal.,"I say Charcoal ! ,but here are the pros and cons for charcoal and gas grills    Charcoal Pros    Food tastes better. That smoked flavor is impossible to duplicate with gas even if you buy the smoke products.     Charcoal grills are less expensive. A quality charcoal grill runs between $50 and $100.     It's easy to find portable charcoal grills to take on trips.    Cooking over charcoal becomes an event. If family members get hooked on cooking over charcoal, they will enjoy playing around with different techniques.     Charcoal Cons    Starting a fire can be a problem especially on damp or rainy days. It does help to keep the charcoal good and dry and an electric firestarter can also be used.    It's easy to burn food over charcoal. The heat is regulated with vents, and the cook must know how to use the vents and lid to keep the fire from flaring or burning too hot.     Coals must cool before the grill can be cleaned. This can take several hours.    A charcoal grill is messy. Grease, charcoal and ashes are not the easiest things to clean up.    Gas Pros    Starting a gas grill is as easy as turning on the gas and pushing a button. Do be careful and follow directions.    Flames and temperatures can be fine tuned with the settings on a gas grill. If you have recipes that call for temperature settings and times, then gas is super simple.    Most gas grills have two sides with separate controls, so it's easy to cook two different things at once even if they require different amounts of heat.     Clean up is really easy.    Gas Cons    Food cooked on a gas grill does not have charcoal flavor no matter what you do.    Gas grills cost more. Expect to pay at least $100 for a good gas grill. Some run in the thousands.    Most gas grills are large and are hard to take on trips.    If you run out of gas, you're out of luck"

"I've experimented with various recipes (proportion of flour, refrigerating dough, etc) as well as oven temperature--my cookies always turn out thin. I want the substantial, gooey kind--crips outside, chewy inside. Any tips?","1) Don't over-mix the dough.   2) Be sure to use cold butter. It takes more work when mixing, but I that should help.   3) Try letting the cookie sheet cool off between batches too - running cold tap water over it helps.  4) If all else fails, try using shortening instead of butter. (And don't use margarine, either.)"

Does cocoa have more or less antioxidants than green tea? What are the benefits of drinking cocoa drinks?,"Cornell University study found that cocoa has up to 3 times the antioxidants of those in green tea, and twice red wine.    The reason that cocoa leads the other drinks is its high content of compounds called phenolic phytochemicals, or flavonoids, indicating the presence of known antioxidants that can stave off cancer, heart disease and other ailments. However, the health benefits are still controversial because of the saturated fats present in chocolate."

Why is red wine good for your heart?,"Studies show that drinking two to three glasses of red wine daily is good for the heart.     The antioxidants properties in red wine lowers the risk of heart disease. However, there is still no proof that consuming antioxidants actually lowers the risk of heart and artery disease.     Besides drinking red wine daily, there are other ways to reduce heart disease. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables and fish, and reduced intake of milk products can reduce the risk of heart disease."

Hold one chopstick between your thumb and middle finger. Position the chopstick so that it lies at the base of your thumb (on the joint) and at the lower joint of the middle finger. This chopstick shouldn't touch the forefinger.  2. Place the other chopstick between your thumb and forefinger. The side of the chopstick should rest against the tip of your thumb; the top of the chopstick should rest against the pad of your forefinger.  3. Be sure the tips of the chopsticks are parallel.  4. Keep the first chopstick stationary as you practice moving the second chopstick toward the stationary one.  5. Use this technique to position the chopsticks around a piece of food.  6. Hold the food firmly as you lift it toward your mouth."

What's the difference between salted and unsalted butter?,"Salted butter:  Salt is added to butter for flavor and as a preservative so it will have a longer shelf life. Salt, however, can sometimes overpower the sweet flavor of the butter and can also mask odors.    Unsalted butter:  has a short shelf life because it contains no preservatives. Using unsalted butter allows the chef to control the amount of salt in a recipe."
My boyfriend doesn't like food with fish sauce.,"It depends on what you're trying to make. If you're talking about straight up fish sauce, soy will work in a pinch, since both are salty.

Why do we need to wash rice before cooking?,"Before, there was a need to rinse rice to remove dirt like twigs and stones.     Long-grain white rice is rinsed before cooking to remove excess starch. Removing the starch makes the rice cook more evenly and it makes the cooked rice less sticky.     In the States, if you rinse the rice, you are rinsing away vitamins, minerals, and iron. Rice is fortified with vitamins, minerals and iron that is applied on the rice. It's up to you whether you want to wash your rice before cooking it."

Any tips?,"Preparing your ingredients before you start is a must when doing stir fry.     You quickly fry the ingredients in a large pan over high heat while constantly stirring to preserve its flavor, color and texture and keep the vegetables crisp.     You prepare your meat or chicken. Cut the meat or chicken into thin bite-size slices and marinate to protect it from overcooking. The marinade can be made with a variety of liquids depending on the flavor you are trying to obtain. Typical marinade ingredients include chicken or beef stock, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, corn starch, brown sugar, rice wine or dry sherry. Marinate for a least one hour, longer is better.     Then, prepare your aromatic mixture consisting of finely chopped herbs and spices that will add flavor and aroma to the stir-fry. Typical aromatics include garlic, scallions, red pepper flakes, shallots, and chili peppers to name a few.     Next, prepare your vegetables by cutting them into small pieces and separating according to their cooking times. Slower cooking vegetables like asparagus and green beans will be added before faster cooking vegetables like pea pods and tomatoes.     Here's a sample recipe for Stir fried chicken and broccoli:    Marinade Ingredients:    1/4 cup chicken stock   1/4 cup dry sherry or rice wine   2 tablespoons soy sauce   2 tablespoons Oyster Sauce   1 tablespoon cornstarch   1 teaspoon of sesame oil   3 boneless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips     Aromatics:    3 cloves garlic, minced   1 tablespoon ginger, minced   1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes   Other Ingredients:    3 tablespoons of oil   1 bunch of broccoli, cut into florets   1 red pepper, julienned   1 large onion, cut into chunks   1/4 cup halved cashew nuts     Start the prep for this recipe combining the marinade ingredients, cutting the chicken breasts into strips and letting that marinate for a while.    Next, cut up your broccoli and onion and julienne the red pepper.     Preheat wok or frying pan over high heat.   Add 2 tablespoons oil and add chicken, reserving marinade. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until chicken is no longer pink. Cook in batches if necessary. Remove and set aside.   Add remaining tablespoon of oil and stir-fry the aromatics for 10 seconds or until fragrant.   Add the vegetables and stir-fry 3-4 minutes.

"Every time I try to make it, it turns out purple!","This recipe depends on flavor and color developed from the process of properly browning the chicken and bacon -- making sure you develop the brown crusty caramelization in the bottom of the pan while browning. With reduction of the sauce, you should not have issues with purple chicken. Keeping the skin on the chicken helps as well. You should not use non-stick pans for any recipe where the sauce needs to have the additional flavor from carmelization. Also, you can always substitute a full flavored- but not too fruity or sweet -- white wine for this dish. The flavor difference would be negligible.    Here is good recipe from Anne Willan's cooking school:"
Is chocolate milk good for kids? Will drinking chocolate milk make them hyper?,"Chocolate milk is good for kids and it tastes good too. Like white milk, it provides the same essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, potassium, phosphorus, riboflavin and niacin. The difference between chocolate milk and white milk is only about 60 calories, which fits into a growing child's total diet.       Sugar does not cause hyperactivity or mood swings in children. Also, the tiny amount of caffeine in chocolate milk is too small to affect most children. The amount of caffeine in chocolate milk is similar to decaffeinated drinks. Colas may contain up to ten times more caffeine than chocolate milk."

How to pick cantaloupes?,"More ways to pick the right cantaloupes:    1. The best thing you can do is smell. This doesn't apply for watermelons. Watermelons are described below. As for cantaloupe: don't look, don't touch, just smell. Ripe cantaloupe smells very sweet and nice. Sniffing out the most aromatic one is the smartest way to pick a cantaloupe or honeydew.   2. Thump test: hold your dominant hand as if ready to knock on a door. Deliver two or three good thumps to the round side of a melon. The sound should be deep and thick, indicating a dense, full fruit. A higher hollow sound can mean unripeness.   3. If a honeydew is beige-skinned with distinct green veins it's probably not ripe yet. If it has a pale yellow color with bright, lemon-colored areas you probably have found a good one.   Cantaloupes are unripe when the skin beneath the textured web is green. Cantaloupes are ripe when orange or gold.   4. Another mark of desirability is a patch that's slightly flat and bleached in color. Melons that develop on the vine flatten under their own weight, and lose color where they sit on hot soil. In general, stem ends should be moist, not moldy. A good melon is firm, but not rock hard. It yields very slightly to pressure but has no soft spots.   5. Ripe cantaloupes rattle only occasionally, so it's an unreliable indicator.     To determine ripeness of cantaloupes and honeydews in order to pick them from the plant, the following indices of maturity are known:     Grasp it firmly, give a tug and a twist. If it falls easily off the vine into your hand, it's ripe."
Why is it better to bake than fry chicken?,"Baking is better than frying. Baking is the easiest technique for cooking chicken parts, produces excellent recipes and smells so good when cooking. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have become a favorite way to prepare chicken, as it is healthier and can be bought easily. Fried chicken has saturated fat, high in cholesterol and sodium. Frying chicken is a messy business.     Your chicken will come out cooked evenly when you bake it in the oven. Plus it's healthier, quicker, easier and tastier."

How do I make fluffy scrambled eggs?,"According to Food Network, use milk to make fluffier scrambled eggs.     Here's a recipe from the Food Network Kitchens site:    Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk in the milk. Season the eggs with salt and beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until combined. Over-beating makes the eggs thin. As the eggs cook, the milk turns into steam, puffing up the eggs as they firm. The traces of sugar, fats and protein in the milk also help to make larger curds. The larger the curds, the more steam is trapped. Water will dilute the flavor and they will not be as soft and fluffy. Donâ€™t add more than five teaspoons of milk per egg, because the eggs canâ€™t absorb all that milk.     Cook the eggs in a heavy nonstick pan or a well-seasoned pan to prevent the eggs from sticking. Donâ€™t use too large a pan either, or the batter will spread out and cook too quickly. An eight-inch pan works well for two eggs, a 10-inch pan for four eggs. Preheating the pan over a medium heat also keeps the eggs from sticking.     Add butter or oil â€“ about a teaspoon per egg â€“ and heat it. Add the eggs and let them begin to set; then, with a heatproof rubber spatula, push the curds to one side and let the uncooked eggs spread over the surface of the pan. Repeat this action until the eggs are cooked to the desired degree of doneness â€“ eggs taste best when slightly moist."
What does cleansing the palate mean?,"Cleansing the palate is most common in wine tasting, however it also used in fine dining. It involves clearing your mouth of any previous taste before trying the next item.    With wine, tasters will try one and then before trying the next one they will have a drink of water and a piece of bread. This is done so that they can judge the next wine completely on its own (without having the taste of the previous wine in their mouth).    The same concept could apply to fine dining where a person wants to fully indulge in each course without having the taste of the previous course still in their mouth."
Are there non alcoholic wines?,"Yes, there are. Winemakers are able to ferment wines but remove the alcohol through various filtration processes."
"Do I have to stick with red wine - red meat, or can I mix it up? Are their certain types of meat that go well with lighter wines?","The red wine rule only goes for heavier meats like steak or lamb.  Spicy meat dishes, like Indian and Hunan entrees, are best accompanied by white wine or beer. Pork, the other white meat, can be accompanied by white wine. Chicken and turkey go well with less heavy reds like pinot noir. Because duck is very rich, it can hold up next to a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Merlot.    When dining out, I ask my server for recommended wine pairings with the menu items. Some restaurants list the suggested accompaniments for you. Take note of the pairings you like so you can serve them yourself at home."

"I read that those with this distinction are able to identify vintage, varietal, etc of wines on tasting and that becoming a Master of Wine is very difficult to achieve. How does one become a master of wine? What credentials do they have?

The qualification is achieved through extensive examination and dissertation, and is generally regarded in the wine industry as setting an extremely high standard of professional knowledge.     Before being allowed to enroll for the two-year program, potential candidates must persuade the Institute that they have the necessary aptitude by submitting an essay and tasting notes. In addition, they must be interviewed by, and obtain the mentoring of, an existing Master of Wine.     Candidates must sit both the theory (four papers) and practical (three blind tastings) parts of the examination in the same year. If they achieve success in only one part, however, they may attempt the remaining part in the subsequent two years. If successful at the examination stage, candidates must then write and submit a dissertation within six months of approval of a synopsis by the Institute's Education and Examination Board.     The Institute states that over the seven year period up to 2000, of the 266 candidates who undertook the programme a total of 85 were successful in passing all parts of the examination and becoming Masters of Wine."

How and why do you decant a wine?,"You decant a wine to separate clear wine from sediment, to mix oxygen in to an ageworthy wine that is being opened while immature, and for aesthetics.    When you do decant a wine, the method differs depending on your purpose.     If you're decanting to avoid sediment, you must pour the wine gently from the bottle to the decanter, making sure not to shake the bottle or pick it up and put it down repeatedly. This way, the sediment will stay at the bottom of the bottle and not mix into the wine.     If you're decanting to breathe an immature wine, you should pour vigorously, with the idea of splashing as much air as possible into the wine."
Does anyone have a recipe for baba ganoush?,"Baba Ghannouj - Eggplant Dip    1 large round eggplant     2 or 3 cloves of garlic     4 Tbs. tahini (Sesame Paste)    3-4 Tbs. fresh lemon juice     Â½ - 1 tsp. salt (to taste)         Garnish    red pepper, chopped parsley, sumac (red-brown spice that has a lemony flavor),Olive oil, toasted ground cumin (optional)         Preparation:    Wash the eggplant and prick with a fork in 5 spots. You need to cook the eggplant and get it really soft. I find that the most flavorful way is to place the whole eggplant directly over the flame of a gas burner on the stove and blacken one side of the eggplant. But if I do the entire eggplant this way it is too smoky flavored. So I blacken Â½ and then I wrap it in foil and bake it on high heat in an oven until it very soft.     (If you like really smoky baba ghannouj â€“ you can cook the entire eggplant on the stove top over a burner turning it with tongs as blackened until cooked through and very soft)         When it is well cooked through, let cool (can douse with cold water), peel the skin off the eggplant (sometimes it is so soft that you actually cut in half and scoop the eggplant away from the skin.

Adjust seasoning.      If using a food processor put cooked eggplant, minced garlic, salt, tahini, lemon juice, and olive oil into bowl and puree to desired texture. Adjust seasoning.      Tips    If mixture seems too thick, add a little cream or half & half.    A pinch of red cayenne makes the flavors blend better.    Play with the balance of the salt and acid (If salt is heavy it can be balanced by lemon and vice-versa.    Can add just a pinch of ground cumin seed (toast it lightly before adding)         Serve in a shallow bowl topped with a swirl of olive oil. Garnish with fine chopped parsley, a dusting of sumac or red pepper."

How long can I keep wine in an open bottle?,"It depends on the type of grape and the quality of the wine, but typically not more than 2-3 hours before oxidation will damage the wine.

Do I have to remove the dark vein when cooking shrimps?,"According to the Food Network, the vein in the small and medium shrimp is only removed for cosmetic purposes. However, the vein is actually used for intestinal purposes, so larger shrimp are usually packing grit which can effect the taste of the dish.  Use the tip of a knife to cut along the backside of the shrimp and remove the vein. the is a cooking tool called a deveiner sold in stores, but i find it easier to ask the butcher for deveined shrimp at the grocery store."
Is siu mai considered a dumpling? What's the difference between dumplings and potstickers?,"Dim sum, a Cantonese term, is usually a light weekend meal or brunch with family and friends. It literally means, order heart, or order to one's heart's content, according to Wikipedia. Dim sum dishes can be ordered from a menu, but at most restaurants the food is wheeled around on carts by servers. The usual choices include steamed buns, dumplings, and rice rolls, but there are always the delectable favorites like chicken feet, tripe, and congee (rice porridge). And don't forget the unlimited tea service!  As for the difference between dumplings and potstickers, potstickers are a form of Chinese dumplings called jiaozi, consisting of meat and mixed vegetables, wrapped into a piece of thin dough. Commonly used fillings are shrimp, beef, pork, or lamb. When jiaozi are fried, that's when they're called potstickers. Another kind of Chinese dumpling are the baozi, which are formed with a thick leavened bun (compared to the thin, noodle-like skin of the jiaozi).  The Wikipedia page on dumplings simply states, There are other kinds of dumplings such as ...Siew Mai... which I found to be a variant spelling of Siu Mai, Siu Mye, and Shu Mai dumplings. These are steamed pork dumplings (though I found some random recipes for chicken siu mai, etc.), and from recipezaar.com, the chef recommends these from a tasting of thirteen other dumplings! They most definitely count as dumplings, especially if they're the tastiest! Best,  `k."

"Refried, black and pinto beans, what are the differences?","Mmm, delicious whichever you choose. But to be specific, black beans (also known as turtle beans) are pea-sized, jet-black oval beans with an earthy, almost smoky flavor and a soft, mealy texture. Pintos are medium-sized long painted beans, with reddish tan skins usually mottled with brown flecks. Though purists might insist upon pintos, these days refried beans of both varieties are available at taquerias and grocery markets (with the other canned foods). Refried beans aren't really fried twice so much as fried well. To refry, add the beans of your choosing to a hot, heavy pan (cast irons recommended) that's been coated in oil (or, if you're going to be traditional, lard) and finely chopped onion and garlic. Mash away with your masher or fork, adding salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer your beans completely creamy, mash until smooth. If not, set aside a cupful and add to the smashed mixture, then reheat. Whenever I make refried beans, I always find myself bored with just the beans themselves, so I'll add finely chopped red and green peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes, or jalapenos. Best,    `k."
"My friend bought a bottle of wine and on the back label, it said something about malolactic fermentation. What does it mean?","Here's a good answer to your question that I found in mainbrace website:    After grapes are picked in the vineyard, they are crushed, then fermented and aged, and then bottled. During fermentation, yeasts turn much of the sugar in the crushed grapes to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Between the fermentation stage and aging, many winemakers subject the wine to another step: malolactic fermentation.     During this step the malic acid present in the wine is converted to lactic acid. This has the effect of reducing the sharpness of the wine and introducing a smooth, sometimes even buttery flavour. (Lactic acid is the acid present in milk and milk products.)    Why do winemakers do this? Although the process has been known for some time, it is only within the last twenty years or so that the demand for easy-drinking, approachable wines has led wineries to strive for smoother wines that can be consumed with comfort without long aging to mellow out their flavours."
All the major things are taken care of but I want to help in some way. Give me a recipe for something complementary to typical thanksgiving fare that will wow my guests.,"I like Polenta with sun dried tomatoes and chipotle as a side dish. It is really quick to make (About 15 min.)and tastes and looks great. Step 1: Make Polenta. I typically take 1 part polenta (corn meal) and 3 parts water and put it in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. About halfway through you should stir it. It will be soft and creamy. Step 2: When the polenta is done, you add chopped sundried tomatoes and some Chipotle sause (I get mine at Trader Joes). The more chipotle the spicier the dish will be. You can eat it right away, or let it sit for a while to cool off and harden. Step 3 (optional) Once it is hard, you can cut it in slices, and quickly brown them under the broiler right before serving."
"I want to throw a birthday party for my husband, but I'm coming up short on ideas. I want to do something around food and drinks, like hors d'oeuvres and a chocolate fountain, but I'm open to themes too--any ideas?","Two themes that are easy to execute buffet style are middle eastern (lots of finger foods and things that can be prepared ahead) and mexican (casserole-type dishes like enchiladas and chilaquiles, chips and salsa and guacamole). You can probably find places that will cater these foods. You might want to do a nod to your husband's heritage by serving foods his family makes, or remember a good time in the past-- like a tropical theme with pictures of your warm weather vacation. If the party is near a holiday or event, you could use that as a theme (the Big Game, decorate your own hand turkey around Thanksgiving!) You can't go wrong with serving his favorite foods-- you know he'll be happy."
What's the difference between European butter and regular butter?,"European butter has a higher percentage of butterfat. That's why they smell so yummy, e.g. plugras."
how hot does turkey stuffing have to be?,"The turkey breast should register 180 degrees and the stuffing should be 165. But the key to getting the stuffing hot enough without overcooking the turkey is to pack the stuffing carefully. Fill the inside of the bird with stuffing, but don't press it in. If you would like additional stuffing, roast it in a separate roasting pan with chicken stock for added flavor. The best tasting stuffing will be inside the turkey, but this way you can be sure there will be enough to go around and no one will get sick! If stuffing a turkey, use a meat thermometer. If stuffing does not reach 165 Â°F when the turkey itself is done to 180 Â°F, further cooking will be required. During the added cooking necessary to bring the stuffing up to a safe temperature, the meat may become overcooked."
"My milk has a Sell By date. That's all very well and good, but how long after the Sell By date can I safely drink it? And my eggs just have a date stamped on them. Is that an Eat By date? What if I eat them the day after the date?","For most products with a Sell-By date, they can be safely eaten up to 7 days after the Sell-By date. The exceptions are beef/pork (3-5 days), and poultry, seafood, or ground meats (2 days). Eggs and yogurt on the other hand carry an Expiration date. These items should not be used after that date. If you eat the item after that date, you may be exposing yourself to bacteria or other pathogens."

Are there any tricks to peeling a butternut squash?,"If you can, cook it first. the skin peels away very easily after it's been roasted (better to roast than boil). If you need to cut up into chunks for sauteeing or something, do this: 1. Cut lengthwise, and then into quarters. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise again if very large (should look like watermelon slices). 2. Take sharp knife parallel to cutting surface and place right between skin and flesh. 3. Run knife along the bottom and remove flesh from the skin. Place hand on top of squash flesh to keep pressure on. 4. cut up into cubes or whatever shape. And remember it should feel more like running the squash along the knife, than moving a knife through the squash. Small difference, but results in fewer cuts."
What is panna cotta?,"Panna cotta means cooked cream in Italian and is very similar in consistency to a custard or flan but without the eggs. Typically it's served with fruit, syrup, or honey. One of my favorite recipes courtesy of Eric Ripert's Return to Cooking: Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Grapefruit Makes 4 servings Preparation Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 35 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling time Ingredients: 1 1/4 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup sugar 1 package granulated gelatin 1 3/4 cups buttermilk Vegetable oil cooking spray 3 large pink grapefruit 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons Vermont honey (or substitute another honey) Method: 1. Bring the cream and sugar to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Combine the gelatin and buttermilk. Once the cream has cooled, add the buttermilk-gelatin mixture and stir to combine. 2. Spray four (6-ounce) ramekins with vegetable spray. Divide the buttermilk-cream mixture between the ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. 3. Meanwhile, cut off the ends of the grapefruit. Using the tip of your knife, cut the peel and pith from the grapefruit. Hold the grapefruit over a bowl to catch the juice and cut out the segments from the fruit. Squeeze the membrane to release all the grapefruit juice. Refrigerate the grapefruit segments. Place the grapefruit juice (you should have at least 1 cup) in a small pot and add the vanilla extract. Bring to a boil and reduce by one third, about 30 minutes . Set aside. 4. To serve, dip the ramekins in hot water for 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around the edge of each ramekin and invert it onto the center of a plate. Arrange the grapefruit segments around the panna cotta in a spiraling fashion. Spoon the sauce over the grapefruit and drizzle the honey over the sauce. Serve immediately."
Why do people put salt around the glass when drinking Margarita?,"Salt is traditionally added to the rim of the glass to provide a sharp contrast in flavor to better experience the drink as a whole. The difference in the salt and the sugar content in the alcohol helps to stimulate all of your tastebuds, which are divided into sectors based on the type of sensation. Take caution to not over-salt the rim of the glass and thus coat only the outside portion of the rim around 1/4... getting salt on the inside of the glass risks modifying the flavor of the drink."
i know of a number of paid services but would like to save money and get ratings/reviews without paying.,"Free is tough, but if it's what you want, then look no further than www.wineaccess.com. It's actually an aggregator of wine retailers (and more, but I won't get into it)--the catch is that you can only check out Steven Tanzer's reviews if one of their wine retailers has the wine in stock. Not sure how broad ST's reviews go, but he seems to cover a lot of US and French wines. They have supplemental reviews by other another rater called CGCW."
And how long was it on the market?,"After New Coke was introduced in 1985, there was a huge outcry among Coke drinkers that forced the company to reintroduce the original formula (rebranded Classic Coke) after just two months. New Coke was eventually renamed Coke II (not to be confused with the more recent C2) and had a tiny market share for a few years. It apparently is no longer sold in the U.S., although it is still listed as one of the company's brands. The Snopes article below has a very detailed history of the New Coke fiasco (also debunking the myth that the whole thing was done on purpose)."
Anyone know what magic goes into creating a rice krispy? is it simply a popped grain of rice like popcorn or something fancier?,"They are made of a sugary rice mixture which is shaped into the form of rice kernels and toasted. These kernels bubble and rise in a manner which forms very thin walls. When the cereal is exposed to milk or juices, these walls tend to collapse suddenly, creating the famous Snap, crackle and pop sounds. This is in contrast to puffed rice, which was introduced in 1904."
do u cook chicken and rice together or separately and combine at the end ?,I have seen recipes that use both kinds of methods. Personally I prefer cooking them seperately and combining at the end. The chicken and rice are cooked seperately and then the rice is layered with chicken in the thick gravy alternately. Check out these recipes: http://www.recipedelights.com/recipes/nonvegdishes/chickenbiryani.htm (chicken and rice are cooked together in the end) (here they are cooked seperately): http://www.daawat.com/recipes/indian/rice/chickenbiryani.htm
What is the best tasting Turkey substitute?,"For vegetarian Turkey substitutes, I personally prefer the Quorn roast over Tofurkey. It's cheaper, smaller (both of which are better for the lone vegetarian in a crowd of meat eaters), and tastes better to me. Downside - I don't think there is a Quorn roast sold with stuffing, so you'll have to figure out how to make sure you get a vegetarian version of that."
"What is the best type of food/cuisine (i.e., American, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, etc)?","Why limit yourself? I have the good fortune to live in a city where all of these cuisines is well-represented among our restaurants. I pick whichever one fits my mood at the time. American: filling, simple, can often be eaten with hands, usually family-friendly fare Chinese: share dishes, can range from bland to quite spicy, excellent starchy rice and noodle dishes, restaurants can accomodate large parties Indian: sauces are subtle with very unusual flavors, tends to be heavier than other cuisines, order a thali if you want little tastes of lots of different foods Thai: usually lighter than Chinese, with subtly different ingredients (e.g. lemongrass), excellent beef dishes Mediterranean: food tends to be blander but long on unusual ingredients (e.g. chickpea flour), most dishes are eaten with your hands, excellent for a family meal. Many Meditteranean restaurants feature belly dancing and live music for a full dining experience"
