"We are considering renting a house in the Turks and Caicos... any recommendations of which islands might be best, and good places to rent from?","I like Providenciales best. Beautiful beaches are scattered on all sides of Providenciales, the most spectacular of which is a 12 mile stretch located on Grace Bay, which is protected by a healthy barrier reef. Provo has an 18 hole golf course, a casino, shopping centres, three marinas, a growing number of of bars and excellent restaurants. Provo is also a divers' and water lovers' paradise."
I'll be spending the weekend in the Paso Robles area and will have time to visit 3 or 4 wineries. Can anyone recommend which ones to visit for the best wine? or the best ambiance? <br><br>Thanks.,Meridian winery is in Paso Robles and it has a good tasting room and the views overlooking the the vineyards are beautiful. A smaller winery which is fun is Bonny Doon.    What's unique to the Paso Robles area are a lot of Mom and Pop wineries which you don't see much of anymore in Napa or Sonoma.    Now is right before harvest time so you can enjoy the vineyards fully loaded with grapes.    Enjoy
I'm planning a trip to China. I'm an adventurous eater and I'd like to think my stomach can handle anything that I encounter that appeals to me. But I know that's risky! Is there anything in particular precautions I should take or things I should avoid to stay healthy on the trip? <br><br>Thanks.,"Number one cause of digestive complaints is the water. Be especially careful to avoid any beverage that has not been pasteurized and vaccuum sealed, or else boiled (such as tea). Avoid ice like the plague, as well as anything such as raw fruits and vegetables that may have been rinsed prior to serving.    On the flip side, most Chinese food is cooked at high heat and therefore is safe as long as no one has touched it with their hands (unlikely given the high temperatures!). That goes for your hands too, wash your hands frequently and always use chopsticks.    Finally, pack a bottle of Pepto Bismol, widely regarded (even in medical studies) as the best treatment for mild traveler's diarrhea. If you meticulously follow the suggestions above you shouldn't encounter any problems Pepto can't handle.    I've traveled in Central America, North Africa, and Asia following these simple guidelines and never gotten sick. However, for much more detailed info, see the link below:"
I need a recommendation for a nice hotel in San Diego (or at least near it) for the weekend. Going down for the MNF game 10/10.

"China Air showed a PG13 with nudity on the way out. They said they are scheduled to show an R on the way back. <br><br>This is highly inappropriate for several reasons, but particulary with children. <br><br>Is this problem afflicting all airlines? <br><br>How have you dealt with this? <br><br>Do airlines publish their movies ahead of time? <br><br>China Air does not have personal movie screens yet.","Most international airlines have atleast 1 or 2 pg-13/R rated movies. But this is out of a possible 30 odd channels (including audio music).  It's not too bad a ratio.  But these airlines have personal screens.    Airlines do publish movie schedule upfront (1 month in advance usually). Not the same movies are shown in all the routes that, that particular airline flies.    The problem you are referring to is completely due to lack of personal screens. It's not so bad when you have personal screens as kids have a few channels dedicated for themselves (cartoons, children's movie, sports channel, comedy channel, etc.)    Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, etc. have personal screens which is very convenient."
I hoped to get in the Mission Ranch Resort for my anniversary but they're sold out for one of the nights I need. Anyone have a suggestion?,"The best high end hotels are Post Ranch Inn and the Ventana Inn, just south of Carmel. The Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Inn at Spanish Bay are also luxurious hotels near Carmel. The Highlands Inn in Carmel is more reasonably priced but less romantic/intimate. The Tickle Pink Inn is even more moderately priced and has great views"
I'm travelling to China in October and I'd like to know where can I get the best exchange rate for US Dollars for Chinese Yuan. Should I do this in the airport? hotel? or find private entrepeneur on the street? <br><br>Thanks.,"You are best off bringing your ATM card and withdrawing money froma machine at the airport when you get there. By using the ATMs you get the wholesale banking rate for that day, which means that you will get a better exchange rate than going those exchange shops or from dealing with travellers checks. The only thing to watch for is the user fee you may get charged by the machine operator as well as your bank, but this happens even domestically. Any user fee ($1-2) will typically offset by the convenience factor in my opinion."

Can you make a day trip out of visiting the Hoover Dam from Las Vegas? Anything else to do there,"You can go to Lake Mead Recreation Park along with the Hoover dam.    You can also have a 5 hour ride and go to the Grand Canyon, but if you are planning on getting back to Las Vegas on the same day then it makes it a very long day. There are bus tours that take you to the Grand Canyon, so you donâ€™t really have to drive"
Is it true that there are no longer cheap buffets in Vegas hotels like in the old days?,"Yes, it is true that buffets are not cheap anymore. The primary reason for that is the standard and cost of living in LV has gone up. It's probably one of the fastest growing (grown) cities in recent months. Real Estate prices have more than doubled - tripled almost in some cases."
Can any one recommend good gifts to bring back for friends from a trip to San Francisco. I'd like them to be inexpensive (less than $40) and unique and emblemnatic of SF. <br><br>Your help is appreciated! Thanks.,"I would go to the SF Ferry Building and pick from the fantastic selection of shops/goodies there...in particular, some chocolate from Scharffenberger or Michael Recchuiti (both bay area natives and expert chocolatiers)--you can easily find stuff for under $40.     If you go on a Saturday morning, I'd go to the the Farmer's Market (which is in back of the Ferry Building) and pick up some June Taylor preserves, which are beautifully packaged, seasonal and delicious. Each jar is about $11."

I am using United Airline's mileage credit card. Not sure if it is good or not.,"I used to have one, but canceled because it didn't do me much good. The best way to earn miles for United is still to fly a lot. After about a year of using the credit card (and charging it a lot), I still did not make it past a general member. Slap on the $75 annual fee, and it wasn't worth it.    Capital One is promoting their no blackout dates on any airline pretty agressively--I'd check that out."
"i am taking a red-eye Friday (Oct 14th 2005) night, and get to Boston 7am. I would like to find a place that I can take a shower before I am giving a talk at 10am. Web search does not yeild much useful. Any clue much appreciated. PS, I have a rental car, so places away from the Airport is also fine, as long as it's within reasonable driving distance, e.g, 20 miles.","I don't know what airline you're flying but some of the airline lounges will likely have these facilities. The American Airlines Admiral's Club in Logan, for instance, has showers (see url below).    If you are not an Admiral's Club member, they do allow you to purchase a one-day pass to access their facilities.     Additionally, Logan also runs some spa/gym facilities in conjunction with hotels. For instance the Hilton Boston Logan Airport, has gym/spa facilities that you could also use--though you likely have to pay some sort of one-day access pass.    Hope this helps!"
Which hotel in Vegas has the best thrill ride?,"Stratosphere has some crazy rides at the top of the tower. These rides wouldn't be as exciting if they were on the ground. However, being over 100 stories in the air, these rides definately give a rush. I won't recommend these if you have a fear of heights. The Manhanttan Express roller coaster at New York New York is great because it's also elevated above ground level and it has an unususal heartline twist. If you want a lot of rides in one place, check out the Adventuredome at Circus Circus."

I'll be in Bangkok for a week. What are the places that I should not miss seeing?,"Wat Arun - Temple of dawn. (Gaze at the temples and buildings patterned using broken pottery). Along the Chao Phrya river, which FYI connects to China, you can see the king's boats - used to cruise down the river himself. I believe the Leornado DiCaprio Movie, The Beach features Khao San Road. This place is famous simply because it's full of nightlife, things to do, many others all down a road. It's in the city's center. Enjoy your trip."
Honeymoon Destinations: Greece vs. Hawaii in March. Any Suggestions?,"We were in Maui last March for our Honeymoon. We had a wonderful time. It is less crowded because it isn't peak season, but nothing was closed. The whales are very active at that time, so whenever we looked out at the ocean we could see a splash or a fluke or a breech. It was wonderful and romantic. Especially when we were on the beach taking photos for the wedding and there was a huge splash against the sunset-- everyone on the beach ooh'd and ahh'd. But the sun wasn't always out, so we weren't on the beach everyday. That was okay with me because there is too mcuh to explore anyways. The trip around the island to Hana was gorgeous with tropical blue water crashing against black lava rocks. It is a very easy, laid-back place. Wonderful for a honeymoon, I think. Good luck!"
What is the ideal honeymoon destination which combines beach and adventure?,"Negril, Jamaica. We took our honeymoon there and I can personally report they have the beach part down pat! We stayed at the Swept Away Resort (which was under different ownership at the time), http://swept-away.com/honeymoon.htm We loved our time here - just stay clear of hurricane season, though we did 10 days in early December without a problem. You could get your adventure quotient from activities at the resort, catamaran sailing, scuba, para-sailing, or day trips out of the resort into Jamaica with many activities to choose from, see http://www.jamaicans.com/tourist/negril/negrilDoSee.htm for an example. Jamaica is not that large, so you can easily travel to other parts of the island outside of Negril to satisfy your adventure thirst."

"looking for a cheap hotel + airfare for new years eve ...since we will be barely spending time in the hotel, a decent (livable) hotel with decent rooms.....somewhere on the strip... pls suggest...",Well.. depend on your definition of cheap. The cheapest hotel I could find that's located on las vegas blvd is around $150 at Mirage. This is cheap enough for me considering the timing in Christmas.

I just visited Rio and had a great time and found all the great things I heard about it to be true. But I also found the rumor that taxi drivers know nothing about the area entirely true. They seldom knew where major streets or locations were and often got lost. I almost missed my flight because my taxi driver couldn't find the airport and then couldn't find the terminal and ended up driving back on the highway. Is there something about the taxi system in Rio that makes drivers less knowledgable than other areas?,"Knowing their profile, my guess is that it's more likely that they actually know excatlly where they are going, but they just want to make more money out of the ride!"
"I'll be in the San Jose area, and would like to eat authentic food. Any suggestions?","Las Delecias Del Maiz is as authentic as you can get--the restaurant is full of locals, and the food is incredibly delicious. Every Wednesday, they make a tasty beef and vegetable soup. If you don't know what to try, get the Fiesta de Gallo, which is a sampler plate with Arroz con Pollo, grilled beef and pork, Picadillos de Papa, plantains, and tortilla. Also try the corn pancake dipped in yogurt. http://www.deliciasdelmaiz.com"
which is the largest lake in the United States?,"I'll assume that when you write largest that you are referring to the surface area of the lake. Superior is the largest lake that's partly in the United States at 31,820 square miles. The largest lake entirely contained in the United States is Lake Michigan, 22,400 square miles. Excluding the great lakes, the Great Salt Lake in Utah is the largest lake in the USA at 1700 square miles. There is a little bit of controversy, as some believe that Lake Michigan and Luke Huron are really one lake at 45,410 square miles. So, depending on who you ask, the answer could be the bi-national Lake Michigan/ Lake Huron, the bi-national Lake Superior, the possibly-only-half-a-lake Lake Michigan or the Great Salt Lake. You could even take it a step further-- if you consider Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to be one lake, you only want to consider lakes entirely within the United States, and you want to restrict it to fresh water lakes, you'd have to look further. Lake Iliamna is the next in line at 1000 square miles. But it's in Alaska, so if you restrict yourself to the 48 contiguous states, you need to cast a wider net still. Lake Okeechobee is next at 700 square miles-- but it's really more of a swamp. So you may want to look even further to Lake Champlain at 490 square miles. So take your pick-- Michigan/Huron, Superior, Michigan, Great Salt, Iliamna, Okeechobee or Champlain!"
I'm going to Korea this Christmas. What type of clothing is good to wear in Korea?,"A parka is light, warm, and stylish. It would be a great choice if you plan to walk around in the cold weather and look good too: http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=9002&pid=315701&scid=315701012"
What is the safest way for a woman to travel solo? I'm planning a trip and I'm open to any destination. Are there some places I should avoid? How can I keep my posessions safe and ensure my personal safety? Should I just join a tour?,"Get to know the countries you're travelling to, particularly local customs such as how women are expected to dress and behave. Respecting those customs will help take you a long way towards gaining respect in return as a foreigner. I also found it very helpful to read current travel boards such as Thorntree by Lonely Planet to find up-to-date information about everything, including safety. If you're considering a country with poor tourist infrastructure or one where you don't think you'd be comfortable travelling alone, a tour can be great. Small groups that focus on using local resources can give you the best of both worlds...you make new friends and your plans are taken care of, but it doesn't feel like a standard canned bus tour. One example (from a good personal experience) is Intrepid Tours (http://www.intrepidtravel.com/). Also, ping your friends to see if they know anyone in the countries you want to visit. They might be very willing give you great tips, show you around, or even provide a place to stay. I planned a 6-month solo trip that ended up with friends of friends doing just that in some of the destinations I was most nervous about!"
"In Paris, is it worth it to purchase a museum pass or should I just pay individually?","Totally worth it, at least for the restrooms. :) The museum pass doesn't get you in to absolutely everything (that'd be another good q&a), but it gets you in to most everything. Additionally, it lets you skip the line to buy tickets in a lot of places - for example, we got to skip the line at Versailles, St. Chappelle, and Musee d'Orsay. It's also pretty nice to be able to go into (almost) any museum, if even for a brief while. We had a nice time spending a few hours in d'Orsay, then going to the Rodin museum for an hour, Invalides for 30 minutes, so on. It's nice that you can go sample a lot of different places, at least briefly. And, honestly, sometimes you go into the museum just to find a good restroom."
"for about one week stay, including airfare, and overwater or beach bungalow stay, around Feb 2006","Me and my wife went to a multi-island Polynesia visit - Tahiti, Huahine, Moorea & Bora Bora. It was incredible! Probably my favoritte place on earth but then again it was our honeymoon. I planned exactly what I wanted by reviewing packages from Tahiti Legends and a few others companies (I have the info at home and will look it up...) but what I ended up doing is booking with CostCo travel which offered the lowest overall price for the exact same product!"
On the flight from San Jose to Seattle I saw Crater Lake and wondered how did Crater Lake come about.,"Crater Lake is found in Southwest Oregon and the second deepest lake in North America (1,932 ft/589 m) and it was previously called Deep Blue Lake in 1853 because of its deep blue color. It was renamed Crater Lake in 1869. Crater Lake was formed by volcanic activity of Mt. Mazama. Crater Lake is the seventh deepest lake in the world. More information about Crater Lake: http://craterlake.wr.usgs.gov/history.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake_National_Park"
and park on the driveway?,"Parkway doesn't refer to parking a car, it refers to the greenery or parkland landscape next to the road. The driveway isn't necessarily meant for parking a car, though many people do. It is the path you drive up to get to the house."
What are the best places to see in San Francisco?,"Where to begin! San Francisco is a great place to visit, and it holds new surprises every time you return. If you've never been before, you may enjoy staying someplace central like Union Square. From there you can BART to the Mission district and as far south as SF Airport, or to the Embarcadero and all the way to the East Bay. Your other public transportation options are the cable car (which picks up right at Powell and Market) and the bus. There are several bus lines that can take you all throughout the city from here. Union Square also houses many upscale shops and some very nice restaurants. I recommend lunch at the Rotunda in Nieman Marcus, which affords a view of all of Union Square. You can take the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf from here. Although it is very touristy, it also gives you a glimpse of what the shipping and canning industry used to be like here. You can also check out the very entertaining Amusing America at Pier 45. You have lots of great seafood dining options in this area. The Embarcadero is very much improved in these past few years. It's now a great promenade and hosts a Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building a couple of times a week. Nearby Embarcadero Center is another shopping destination. If you're here in the spring/summer, definitely try to catch a Giants game at SBC Park, which is a world class ball park! If you come in summer, you'll likely run into one of the many street fairs that happen in neighborhoods throughout the city. Lots of good food, interesting crafts, live music and a real taste of San Francisco. There are a lot of terrific museums here. Downtown you'll find the SF MoMA, which is a decent collection in a gorgeous building. Right across the street is Yerba Buena Gardens and the Metreon, where you can catch a movie, play a game of billiards or even go virtual bowling. The DeYoung just reopened in a brand new building. That will put you right in the heart of Golden Gate Park, which has bike paths, gardens, a conservatory of flowers, the Japanese tea garden, man-made lakes, and even a bison paddock. You'll get a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marina Green and Crissy field, both of which are great for walking, exercising, and just plain people watching! I could go on and on! San Francisco has something to offer everyone, and is worth more than one trip!"
"I'm going to Seattle for the first time, for just a weekend. What are the sites I shouldn't miss? I heard there's a good winery in the area too...","If you have just a weekend, you can go to the Space Needle + Experience Music Project (they are adjacent) and monorail over to downtown where you can walk to Pike's Place Market. Now... if you are interested in night life, you can hit Capitol club, Baltic room, and Linda's all within walking distance from each other on pine street in Capitol Hill. Capitol Hill is just up the Hill to the East from downtown. If you go there during the day, there are also a bunch on funky shops on Broadway, Pike and Pine Streets."

Where should I get my dollars exchanged to Real?,"Don't. Use a credit card when possible for the best rate, plus it's much safer than carrying around cash in Brazil. If you need cash for incidentals (taxi, etc.), withdraw from an ATM - small service fee but good rates."
"I have a 5 and an 8 year old. Would like your input on sites to see, restaurants to visit and interesting shops we can't miss.","Definitely the Lincoln Center skating rink. Its such a symbol, and there's always a lot going on around that area (with NBC Studios near by). Then there's a huge toy store, FAO Schwarz, that's fun to play in w/ or w/o your kids. I think this is where they filmed part of the movie, Big, by Tom Hanks. Here's the address: New York 767 Fifth Avenue (Fifth Avenue at 58th Street) New York, NY 10153 212-644-9400 ext. 4242 Holiday Hours November 25, 2005 through December 25, 2005: Mon - Sat: 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Sun: 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m."
What is the best cruise line for someone in their 20's?,"Carnival has done a good job of branding themselves as The Fun Ships with a singles party atmosphere, but there are other great choices for singles depending on your interest, preferences or budget. Royal Carribbean also has built some *huge* ships with interesting sports amenities (rock climbing wall, ice rink, surfing pool(!!), etc) which are good for active singles. And I've heard they also are a great place to meet people. If you want to go on a smaller, more intimate ship, I've heard Windstar is great. It's more luxurious but also more expensive. The cruise lines to avoid (which tend to have an older over 50 crowd) are Holland America and Princess (also more expensive than RC or Carnival) The Cruise Critic website is a great source of cruise and cruise line reviews."
I will be in Oman for 10 days. Any place you recommend?,Of course the capital Muscat. Other recommendations are Rubi and Salala are very nice as well. Most of the cities are near the coast. The mainland is mainly desert.
"What's the best gas station to fill up en route to SF Airport, when coming from Sunnyvale?","I would use the Mathilda Shell Gas/Filling/Petrol Station which is conveniently located near the 101-N highway, so you can get right on the freeway to the airport (SFO). The airport is still close enough that your gas indicator will be on the F, so no gas charge. The Mathilda Shell station is located here: 776 N Mathilda Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3510 Directions from the Yahoo! Sunnyvale office to station: http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?newaddr=701+First+Avenue&taddr=776+N+Mathilda+Ave&csz=94089&country=us&tcsz=Sunnyvale+CA&tcountry=us&oerr=-3001&name=Y%21+Sunnyvale Onward directions to the airport: Just turn right out of the station and the on-ramp to 101-N is on the right, just across the intersection.

What are the places to see while in Perth?,"Fremantle and it's pubs/clubs, Cottesloe Beach (with a pub at the beach), Kings Park (on the Swan River), The Quokkas on Rottnest Island, The Pinnacles at Nanbung national park, A Sunday session at the North Shore or Cottesloe, A night in Northbridge, Margaret River (to the south), Kalbarri (a long way to the north), Monkey Mia (even more of a long way to the north), and lastly if you're interested in WA's goldmining history a 1 hour flight to Kalgoorlie is worth thinking about. You'll find these and other things to do and see at: http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/ Update: Since you have extended the deadline on this question, maybe you should add some more detail about the type of things you are looking to do in Perth."
