do u cook chicken and rice together or separately and combine at the end ?,I have seen recipes that use both kinds of methods. Personally I prefer cooking them seperately and combining at the end. The chicken and rice are cooked seperately and then the rice is layered with chicken in the thick gravy alternately.
