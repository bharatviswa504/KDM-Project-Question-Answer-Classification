I tried configuring and setting up my wirelesss router which I bought from CompUSA but it won't let me get online even though it detects my IP address and shows a strong wireless connection. What could be the problem?,"Few things to look for: 1. Do you have cable or dsl or dial connection? 2. Earlier when you did not have the router, were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? If so, you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password. For SBC DSL modem you can do it by http://192.168.1.0/ and there is a option available in advanced configuration to do that. 3. Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to the WAN port of the router? 4. Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? Check it by Start->Run->Cmd->ipconfig. It should show you some IP address like 192.168.1.x. 5. Run the following command in the command window (start->Run->cmd) ping www.yahoo.com Hope this helps."
