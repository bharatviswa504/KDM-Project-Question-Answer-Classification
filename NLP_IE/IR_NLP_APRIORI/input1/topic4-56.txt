Does anyone have a recipe for baba ganoush?,"Baba Ghannouj - Eggplant Dip    1 large round eggplant     2 or 3 cloves of garlic     4 Tbs. tahini (Sesame Paste)    3-4 Tbs. fresh lemon juice     ½ - 1 tsp. salt (to taste)         Garnish    red pepper, chopped parsley, sumac (red-brown spice that has a lemony flavor),Olive oil, toasted ground cumin (optional)         Preparation:    Wash the eggplant and prick with a fork in 5 spots. You need to cook the eggplant and get it really soft. I find that the most flavorful way is to place the whole eggplant directly over the flame of a gas burner on the stove and blacken one side of the eggplant. But if I do the entire eggplant this way it is too smoky flavored. So I blacken ½ and then I wrap it in foil and bake it on high heat in an oven until it very soft.     (If you like really smoky baba ghannouj – you can cook the entire eggplant on the stove top over a burner turning it with tongs as blackened until cooked through and very soft)         When it is well cooked through, let cool (can douse with cold water), peel the skin off the eggplant (sometimes it is so soft that you actually cut in half and scoop the eggplant away from the skin. Chop into small pieces. Mash two or three cloves of garlic to a paste with about the same volume of salt. Add to eggplant, Blend the tahini with the lemon juice and stir into the eggplant. Adjust seasoning.      If using a food processor put cooked eggplant, minced garlic, salt, tahini, lemon juice, and olive oil into bowl and puree to desired texture. Adjust seasoning.      Tips    If mixture seems too thick, add a little cream or half & half.    A pinch of red cayenne makes the flavors blend better.    Play with the balance of the salt and acid (If salt is heavy it can be balanced by lemon and vice-versa.    Can add just a pinch of ground cumin seed (toast it lightly before adding)         Serve in a shallow bowl topped with a swirl of olive oil. Garnish with fine chopped parsley, a dusting of sumac or red pepper."
