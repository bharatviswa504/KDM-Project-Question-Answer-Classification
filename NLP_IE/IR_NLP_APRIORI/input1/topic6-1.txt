"We are considering renting a house in the Turks and Caicos... any recommendations of which islands might be best, and good places to rent from?","I like Providenciales best. Beautiful beaches are scattered on all sides of Providenciales, the most spectacular of which is a 12 mile stretch located on Grace Bay, which is protected by a healthy barrier reef. Provo has an 18 hole golf course, a casino, shopping centres, three marinas, a growing number of of bars and excellent restaurants. Provo is also a divers' and water lovers' paradise."
