is it a good idea to lease a car? dare to share experience?,"It is a fine idea to lease a car if: -Tend to switch cars every couple years -Drive a fairly consistent number of miles every year (which is under the limit) -You want to drive a car which is in demand and has a high resale value. -You have no interest in modifying your car Essentially, with a lease you are financing the depreciation of the car over the time you are driving it. For instance, for a 40K BMW, it may depreciate to around $28K after two years, so you finance the $12K difference. Since lease prices are tied to depreciation and not base price of a vehicle, you can afford a more expensive car than you would ordinarily be able to finance. Typically the best deals are through the finance arms of the manufacturers of the cars. Keep these facts in mind and you'll be fine."
