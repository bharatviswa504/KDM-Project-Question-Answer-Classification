Why is it better to bake than fry chicken?,"Baking is better than frying. Baking is the easiest technique for cooking chicken parts, produces excellent recipes and smells so good when cooking. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have become a favorite way to prepare chicken, as it is healthier and can be bought easily. Fried chicken has saturated fat, high in cholesterol and sodium. Frying chicken is a messy business.     Your chicken will come out cooked evenly when you bake it in the oven. Plus it's healthier, quicker, easier and tastier."
