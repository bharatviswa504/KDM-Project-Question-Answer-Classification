"i've been using tags in products such as delicious, my web 2.0, and flickr...but how do i explain the significance of tagging to somebody like my mom? what does it all mean?","Tags are like post-it notes that readers of the content leave behind for other readers. They give clues to the context and meaning beyond a simple description. They're like finding notes in a text book scribbled by a previous owner. You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes. Now imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular post-its thanks to an index of all of them. This is where the real power of tagging lies-- in the weight and meaning these agreed-upon notes give. Of course, context is everything. Next time you're together, show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent, most popular, most frequently used tags. I find my parents only get these new paradigms when I show them to them in context."
