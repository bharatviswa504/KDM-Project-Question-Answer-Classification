"I have a 5 and an 8 year old. Would like your input on sites to see, restaurants to visit and interesting shops we can't miss.","Definitely the Lincoln Center skating rink. Its such a symbol, and there's always a lot going on around that area (with NBC Studios near by). Then there's a huge toy store, FAO Schwarz, that's fun to play in w/ or w/o your kids. I think this is where they filmed part of the movie, Big, by Tom Hanks.
