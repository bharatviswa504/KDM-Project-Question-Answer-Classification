"Don't want to go overboard on budget or features. Just want something better than a 17 monitor to work and play with. More interested in quality, performance, ease of use.","The answer to this question changes from day to day. Dell flatscreens have a good reputation. If you stay away from the very biggest screens (25 for example) you can save a lot of money. SharkeyExtreme (www.sharkeyextreme.com) recommends 17 LCDs for the most savings (~ $250). If you want something a little bigger, they suggest the Dell Ultrasharp 2005FPW 20.1 LCD. I got one of those myself and it's gorgeous. I checked www.shopper.com and found one for $518."
