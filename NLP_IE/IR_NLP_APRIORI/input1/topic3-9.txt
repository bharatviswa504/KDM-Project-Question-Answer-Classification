"[colleges & univs] <br><br>Upto 1980s and early 90s, Big Ten conference had only 10 schools. But then somehow it was decided to add PSU as the 11th Big-Ten school. <br><br>Any thoughts/insight on why the name of the conference not changed?",i would think to keep the brand recognition and the history of the Big Ten. the conference has invested a lot in building the Big Ten name as well as any merchandising and corporate sponsorship.
