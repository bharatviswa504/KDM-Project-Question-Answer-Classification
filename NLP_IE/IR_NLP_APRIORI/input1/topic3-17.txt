And what each one’s specialty? Meaning – what area each one is famous in being the best among the California’s College,"Best really depends on what you want. For example, UC Berkeley is generally considered the best public university because it is the most competitive and probably has the highest number of faculty with various honors such as Nobel Prizes. But if, for example, you're interested in veterinary medicine or oenology (science of winemaking), UC Davis is better. If you want a greater focus on undergraduate education, many students prefer UC Santa Cruz.    In addition to the other private universities that have been mentioned (Stanford, Caltech, and USC), there is a group of small private colleges called the Claremont consortium that is very highly rated. It includes Pomona College, Scripps College, and Harvey Mudd College. Each of these colleges has a special focus, but students in all of them get to share facilities and cross-register for classes."
