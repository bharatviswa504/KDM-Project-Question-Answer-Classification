what are the limitations for that kind of an istallation,"1. Physical compatibility- does the new engine work with the existing transmission? If not, is a transmission available that will fit the chassis? Does the increased weight of the engine require a new set of springs and shocks up front so as not to upset the handling balance?    2. Electrical compatibility- does the stock wiring harness and ECU work? If not, how much work to rip out the harness and put in a compatible one. Is a compatible harness available or does it need to be custom made (often this is a bigger obstacle than 1.)    3. Durability. If there is a 3.0L version of the car that you currently own, does it have different components to withstand the stress of the extra power? Specifically universal joints, driveshafts, and brakes.    Often it is easier and cheaper to sell your car and buy the 3.0L version of the car you own."
