What are the pros and cons for web developers when using CSS,"PRO: CSS is designed to allow the separation of presentation and structure. Font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes are moved into a stylesheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML code. The HTML documents become much smaller and web browsers will usually cache sites' CSS stylesheets. This leads to a reduction in network traffic and noticeably quicker page downloads.    CON:   Naming can get confusing. For example, authors might associate the class name with desired presentational attributes; for example, a CSS class to be applied to emphasized text might be named bigred, implying that it is rendered in a large red font. While such a choice of naming may be intuitive to the document author, it can cause problems if the author later decides that the emphasized text should instead be green; the author is left with a CSS class called bigred that describes something that is green.     There are bugs in CSS that you need to work out when you need it to work across multiple browsers & platforms, and its harder to debug than with a simple HTML."
