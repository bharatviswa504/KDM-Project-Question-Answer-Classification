"What's the best gas station to fill up en route to SF Airport, when coming from Sunnyvale?","I would use the Mathilda Shell Gas/Filling/Petrol Station which is conveniently located near the 101-N highway, so you can get right on the freeway to the airport (SFO). The airport is still close enough that your gas indicator will be on the F, so no gas charge. The Mathilda Shell station is located here: 776 N Mathilda Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085-3510 Directions from the Yahoo! Sunnyvale office to station: http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?newaddr=701+First+Avenue&taddr=776+N+Mathilda+Ave&csz=94089&country=us&tcsz=Sunnyvale+CA&tcountry=us&oerr=-3001&name=Y%21+Sunnyvale Onward directions to the airport: Just turn right out of the station and the on-ramp to 101-N is on the right, just across the intersection. Good luck!"
