"I would like to start a blog and I would like to have recommendations on which blog website to use, with best functionalities, advertising opportunities on the site, traffic, etc? Thanks!","It really depends on your level of tech proficiency. If you don't know HTML, www.blogger.com is really simple to use. If you want to do a lot of customization, www.typepad.com is probably better."
