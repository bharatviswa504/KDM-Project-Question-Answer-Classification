I'm travelling to China in October and I'd like to know where can I get the best exchange rate for US Dollars for Chinese Yuan. Should I do this in the airport? hotel? or find private entrepeneur on the street? <br><br>Thanks.,"You are best off bringing your ATM card and withdrawing money froma machine at the airport when you get there. By using the ATMs you get the wholesale banking rate for that day, which means that you will get a better exchange rate than going those exchange shops or from dealing with travellers checks. The only thing to watch for is the user fee you may get charged by the machine operator as well as your bank, but this happens even domestically. Any user fee ($1-2) will typically offset by the convenience factor in my opinion."
