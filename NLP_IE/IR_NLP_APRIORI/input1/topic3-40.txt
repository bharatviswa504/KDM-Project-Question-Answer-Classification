Would it seriously affect my chances of getting into college if I don't have a high SAT score?,"Unfortunately, the answer is Maybe. If you are trying to get into a top tier school with very selective admissions, then a low SAT/ACT score is virutally a kiss of death. However, if you are looking at most state univerisities, then a low SAT/ACT score is not too bad. You may have to take a few remedial courses. MOST IMPORTANT!! A low SAT/ACT score WILL NOT stop you from going to college. And, in the long run, it really doesn't matter very much where you get your undergraduate degree (as long as the college/university is regionally accredited). For example, a degree in education from ANY regionally NCATE accredited school will get you hired as a teacher. An engineering degree from ANY ABET accredited school will get you hired as an engineer. Enjoy"
