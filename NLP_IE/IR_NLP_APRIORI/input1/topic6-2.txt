I'll be spending the weekend in the Paso Robles area and will have time to visit 3 or 4 wineries. Can anyone recommend which ones to visit for the best wine? or the best ambiance? <br><br>Thanks.,Meridian winery is in Paso Robles and it has a good tasting room and the views overlooking the the vineyards are beautiful. A smaller winery which is fun is Bonny Doon.    What's unique to the Paso Robles area are a lot of Mom and Pop wineries which you don't see much of anymore in Napa or Sonoma.    Now is right before harvest time so you can enjoy the vineyards fully loaded with grapes.    Enjoy
