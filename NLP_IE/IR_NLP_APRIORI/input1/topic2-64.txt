what is the best podcast to subscribe to?,"This Week in Tech is a great podcast. It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week, usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak. It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week. It's been the top podcast for some time now, probably because of the well known, intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality. Browsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in."
