What is a blog?,"There are several types of blogs, or Web logs. They have outgrown their old description of an online diary and have become a new way for citizen publishers to share opinions and information.    There are commercial blogs, like Captain Morgan's Rum's Captain's Blog which mainly serves to market a product.  There are political blogs, which gained prominence in the last election for scooping traditional news sources on some stories.  There are technology blogs, which alert developers and consumers to emerging trends and products.   You can find a blog on any subject under the sun, from new parents gushing over their offspring to serious commentary about world events.     To discover new and interesting blog content, I recommend Technorati and Feedster."
