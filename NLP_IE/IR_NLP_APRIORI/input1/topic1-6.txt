Why hybrid cars gas mileage is better in city ?,"hybrid cars save energy in two ways:  1.by storing energy from the breaks 2.by engaging the gas motor only in it's most effective work RPM meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed (close to the most efficient motor RPM) Having said the above, driving in the city almost never gets you to the efficient RPM.  Also- it is true that the same energy that is being stored in the cars' battery needed to be generated by chemic energy. The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco, the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.  You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.  So- all in all- I the hybrid benefits are more visible in city driving"
