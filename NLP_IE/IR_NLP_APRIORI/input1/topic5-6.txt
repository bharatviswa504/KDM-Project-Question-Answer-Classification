What will the gun ban in the city accomplish? Will crime rate in San Francisco drop?,"The gun ban meassure makes it illegal to posses or sell firearms and ammunition anywhere in the city of San Francisco. The National Rifle Association has sued to overturn this ban. When a similar ban passed in 1982, the NRA sued and succesfully overturned the ban.    As for crime rate, it is hard to predict. A common argument made by right wing gun supporters says, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will sell guns. And Michael Moore, a prominent left wing activist and film maker, concluded in his film Bowling for Columbine that it is not necessarily the guns that make American culture violent (he points to how Canadians have even greater access to firearms, yet their crime rate is significantly lower).     Anti-gun arguments include: *Citizens have no need to own guns to protect themselves against crime because government is tasked with that obligation. *Guns, being devices implicitly designed to kill, raise the level of violence in any disagreement between people. *Guns are more dangerous to the owners than to intended targets because most gun related deaths are a result of domestic violence, accidents, and suicides.    According to the third link below, when D.C. banned firearms in 1976, the murder rate increased:    Crime has risen significantly since the gun ban went into effect. In the five years before Washington's ban in 1976, the murder rate fell from 37 to 27 per 100,000. In the five years after it went into effect, the murder rate rose back up to 35. In fact, the murder rate after 1976 has never fallen back to what it was in 1976. Robberies and overall violent crime changed just as dramatically.    But obviously in the real world there are many variables that affect the crime rate. So it is hard to truly measure what kind of impact a gun ban has on crime rate since you cannot isolate it from all of the other variables."
