What is the ideal honeymoon destination which combines beach and adventure?,"Negril, Jamaica. We took our honeymoon there and I can personally report they have the beach part down pat! We stayed at the Swept Away Resort (which was under different ownership at the time), http://swept-away.com/honeymoon.htm We loved our time here - just stay clear of hurricane season, though we did 10 days in early December without a problem. You could get your adventure quotient from activities at the resort, catamaran sailing, scuba, para-sailing, or day trips out of the resort into Jamaica with many activities to choose from, see http://www.jamaicans.com/tourist/negril/negrilDoSee.htm for an example. Jamaica is not that large, so you can easily travel to other parts of the island outside of Negril to satisfy your adventure thirst."
