Should cell phones and PDAs be allowed in school? Why or why not?,"I don't think Cell Phones and PDAs should be allowed since students may spend lot of time playing with (and showing off) the cool features of these gadgets. Also, some features can be misused (eg. camera phones). For communicating during emergency situations, I am sure school phones can be used."
