I want to know the meaning of the word and how to explain to my friends.,"Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film Tango & Cash. After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:    Gabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...    Ray Tango: What's F.U.B.A.R.?    Gabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition."
