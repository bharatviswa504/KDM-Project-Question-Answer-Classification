I seem to be having my temporary memory lapse and can't seem to be recollecting my deceased wife's name. Can someone help? <br><br>-- 007,"In the movies, James Bond gets Married at the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but unfortunately his wife dies very soon thereafter when the bad guys shoot her while trying to gun down James. Her name was Contessa Teresa 'Tracy' Di Vicenzo Bond, she was played by Diana Rigg.    I've never read the books, so I don't know if he every married in the books."
