Why is the Mini commonly called a Mini Cooper? Who is Cooper?,John Cooper was Alec Issigonis' friend and also a race car driver. They collaborated on making a sportier Mini which was then called the Mini Cooper. Interestingly the Mini Cooper is the base model here in the US (which is why all minis here are Coopers) but in europe there is a lower priced model just named the Mini One. As a result the phrase Mini Cooper is not interchangable with Mini in europe.
