"I am looking for a basic desktop (nothing fancy) for my 7 year old. Unfortunately, I could not wake up early enough to be in line (among the first 20) at BestBuy for the Day After Thanksgiving sale to get the $149.00 eMachines PC.","How about the $299 Dell Dimension B110 (after $50 rebate). Intel Celeron D at 2.53ghz, 256MB RAM, 80GB hard drive, 17 CRT. You also get a free Dell color inkjet printer."
