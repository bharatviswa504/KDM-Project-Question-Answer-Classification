"What is the best type of food/cuisine (i.e., American, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, etc)?","Why limit yourself? I have the good fortune to live in a city where all of these cuisines is well-represented among our restaurants. I pick whichever one fits my mood at the time. American: filling, simple, can often be eaten with hands, usually family-friendly fare Chinese: share dishes, can range from bland to quite spicy, excellent starchy rice and noodle dishes, restaurants can accomodate large parties Indian: sauces are subtle with very unusual flavors, tends to be heavier than other cuisines, order a thali if you want little tastes of lots of different foods Thai: usually lighter than Chinese, with subtly different ingredients (e.g. lemongrass), excellent beef dishes Mediterranean: food tends to be blander but long on unusual ingredients (e.g. chickpea flour), most dishes are eaten with your hands, excellent for a family meal. Many Meditteranean restaurants feature belly dancing and live music for a full dining experience"
