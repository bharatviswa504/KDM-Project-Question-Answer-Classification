How much do sound cards cost?,"Sound cards vary depending on their quality. They also vary in price by how many channels they support, I.E. Some only support 5.1 surround, and others can handle 7.1. They generally vary in price from $50 - $200. NewEgg has great deals on computer hardware. I recommend buying from them, and you can browse through their products and read reviews of people who have purchased them. http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Category.asp?Category=36"
