Any learning center that offers Personalized tutoring programs in Portland?,"The answer above is a great idea. Of course, this will only work if you don't mind non-person to person tutoring. I would contact your local high schools and see if there are any tutors that will tutor your kid. It might help both the high school student (elective credit) and your kid (because young kids look up to high school students). Newspapers are always advertising people looking for work such as nannies, care-takers, and yes...even tutors. I would try the high schools first.
