Why does my BMW take only premium gasoline?,"BMW engines are designed to run at a high compression ratio. If you took chemistry in high school, you remember the ideal gas rule PV=nRT which essentially states that with increased pressure you get increased temperatures. So the cylinders in a bmw run hot. Premium gas ignites at a higher temperature, so it is compatible with the engine in your car.     Regular gas has the same amount of energy but will catch on fire prematurely in your cylinders causing knocking and pinging which is bad for your engine. If you put regular gas your car, it is smart enough to catch it but you will have less power. Also a tiny amount of damage can potentially happen each time you do this as the car will assume it's premium then dial back in response to the pinging. So I wouldn't do it for any extended period of time.    It is important to know that cars designed to run on regular gas do not benefit AT ALL from using premium, so don't bother."
