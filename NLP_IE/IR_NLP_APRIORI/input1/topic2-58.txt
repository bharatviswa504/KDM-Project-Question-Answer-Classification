what is the most popular programming laguage in use today?,"This is a tough one, and no doubt a potential debate point in most cases. I would really doubt that C# has any real future. Java, on the other hand, is written in C. Most modern development platforms have a foundation in C. If this question is to choose a language path for school, I think either Java or C is fine. Though I would say that you will become a better programmer if you have a more detailed understanding of what is under the hood. In that case C (and a bit of assembly isn't bad to at least take a look at). The more higher-level you go, the less you can ultimately do."
