Is siu mai considered a dumpling? What's the difference between dumplings and potstickers?,"Dim sum, a Cantonese term, is usually a light weekend meal or brunch with family and friends. It literally means, order heart, or order to one's heart's content, according to Wikipedia. Dim sum dishes can be ordered from a menu, but at most restaurants the food is wheeled around on carts by servers. The usual choices include steamed buns, dumplings, and rice rolls, but there are always the delectable favorites like chicken feet, tripe, and congee (rice porridge). And don't forget the unlimited tea service!  As for the difference between dumplings and potstickers, potstickers are a form of Chinese dumplings called jiaozi, consisting of meat and mixed vegetables, wrapped into a piece of thin dough. Commonly used fillings are shrimp, beef, pork, or lamb. When jiaozi are fried, that's when they're called potstickers. Another kind of Chinese dumpling are the baozi, which are formed with a thick leavened bun (compared to the thin, noodle-like skin of the jiaozi).  The Wikipedia page on dumplings simply states, There are other kinds of dumplings such as ...Siew Mai... which I found to be a variant spelling of Siu Mai, Siu Mye, and Shu Mai dumplings. These are steamed pork dumplings (though I found some random recipes for chicken siu mai, etc.), and from recipezaar.com, the chef recommends these from a tasting of thirteen other dumplings! They most definitely count as dumplings, especially if they're the tastiest! Best,  `k."
