What's the ugliest car on the road?,"The Pontiac Aztek. Cars like the Scion xB and Toyota Prius are polarizing cars but they sell in big numbers and hit their targets. The Aztek was frighteningly faithful to its concept vehicle and answered a question that no one asked: what would happen if we put a sloping rear window and regular doors on a minivan? Heads should have rolled at GM for that decision, the sales for the Aztek have been abysmal since its launch."
