On the flight from San Jose to Seattle I saw Crater Lake and wondered how did Crater Lake come about.,"Crater Lake is found in Southwest Oregon and the second deepest lake in North America (1,932 ft/589 m) and it was previously called Deep Blue Lake in 1853 because of its deep blue color. It was renamed Crater Lake in 1869. Crater Lake was formed by volcanic activity of Mt. Mazama. Crater Lake is the seventh deepest lake in the world.
