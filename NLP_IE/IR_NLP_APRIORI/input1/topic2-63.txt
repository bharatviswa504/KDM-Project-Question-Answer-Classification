Should both computers use the same OS to share my DSL?,"DSL usually requires PPPoE connections. Most consumer routers will provide this functionality for you. Simply enter your username and password into the router and it will maintain a persistent connection for you. Then, each computer on your network can simply obtain a DHCP address from the router and use the Internet without any special software. Windows, Linux, MacOS, and other operating systems should be compatible with little or no configuration."
