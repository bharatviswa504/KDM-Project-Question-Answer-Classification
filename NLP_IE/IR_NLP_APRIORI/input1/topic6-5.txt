"China Air showed a PG13 with nudity on the way out. They said they are scheduled to show an R on the way back. <br><br>This is highly inappropriate for several reasons, but particulary with children. <br><br>Is this problem afflicting all airlines? <br><br>How have you dealt with this? <br><br>Do airlines publish their movies ahead of time? <br><br>China Air does not have personal movie screens yet.","Most international airlines have atleast 1 or 2 pg-13/R rated movies. But this is out of a possible 30 odd channels (including audio music).  It's not too bad a ratio.  But these airlines have personal screens.    Airlines do publish movie schedule upfront (1 month in advance usually). Not the same movies are shown in all the routes that, that particular airline flies.    The problem you are referring to is completely due to lack of personal screens. It's not so bad when you have personal screens as kids have a few channels dedicated for themselves (cartoons, children's movie, sports channel, comedy channel, etc.)    Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, etc. have personal screens which is very convenient."
