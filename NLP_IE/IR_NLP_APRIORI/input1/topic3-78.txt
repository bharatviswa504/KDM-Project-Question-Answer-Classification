What can be done to lower the dropout rate in High Schools?,"To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention. In other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. Each learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. The NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student. One of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning. hope this helps!"
