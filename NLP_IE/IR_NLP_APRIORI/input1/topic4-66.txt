I'm pretty sure there's fish sauce in it.,"I asked my friend and she says it's nuoc mam pha.    You need the ff:    60 ml water  1 teaspoon rice vinegar  2 teaspoons Sugar  1 Red chili, seeded and finely chopped  2 cloves Garlic, peeled and crushed  1 teaspoon Lime juice  2 tablespoons Fish sauce    Mix ingredients together and serve as a dipping sauce.     If making in larger amounts however, bring water, vinegar and sugar to the boil then allow to cool before adding chili, garlic and lime juice.     Stir in fish sauce before serving."
