I'm planning a trip to China. I'm an adventurous eater and I'd like to think my stomach can handle anything that I encounter that appeals to me. But I know that's risky! Is there anything in particular precautions I should take or things I should avoid to stay healthy on the trip? <br><br>Thanks.,"Number one cause of digestive complaints is the water. Be especially careful to avoid any beverage that has not been pasteurized and vaccuum sealed, or else boiled (such as tea). Avoid ice like the plague, as well as anything such as raw fruits and vegetables that may have been rinsed prior to serving.    On the flip side, most Chinese food is cooked at high heat and therefore is safe as long as no one has touched it with their hands (unlikely given the high temperatures!). That goes for your hands too, wash your hands frequently and always use chopsticks.    Finally, pack a bottle of Pepto Bismol, widely regarded (even in medical studies) as the best treatment for mild traveler's diarrhea. If you meticulously follow the suggestions above you shouldn't encounter any problems Pepto can't handle.    I've traveled in Central America, North Africa, and Asia following these simple guidelines and never gotten sick. However, for much more detailed info, see the link below:"
