when should i change the tires of my car?,The link that was posted above says 2/32 of an inch of tread is when to change. This is absolutely correct and is the legal limit in some states. The easiest way to check is to do the Lincoln test with a penny. Take a penny and insert Lincoln's head into you tire tread where the tread is most worn. If you can see above Lincoln's head then you need a new tire. If his head is obscured by the tread then you are still ok.
