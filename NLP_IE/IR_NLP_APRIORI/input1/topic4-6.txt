"I've experimented with various recipes (proportion of flour, refrigerating dough, etc) as well as oven temperature--my cookies always turn out thin. I want the substantial, gooey kind--crips outside, chewy inside. Any tips?","1) Don't over-mix the dough.   2) Be sure to use cold butter. It takes more work when mixing, but I that should help.   3) Try letting the cookie sheet cool off between batches too - running cold tap water over it helps.  4) If all else fails, try using shortening instead of butter. (And don't use margarine, either.)"
