how to make perfect ribs,"I'm from Kansas, and KC BBQ is of course my fav. I think there are 3 things: 1. good rub, 2. slow cooking with good moisture, 3. good sauce.    I like this rub: http://www.recipezaar.com/16732  This cooking plan: http://www.recipezaar.com/16794  This sauce: http://www.recipezaar.com/16745    It's all from Gates BBQ in KC, which has the best extra hot BBQ sauce ever! But you have to buy that from them :-)"
