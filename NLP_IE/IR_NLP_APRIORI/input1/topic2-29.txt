what is the max file size on UNIX?,"It depends on which Unix you're talking about, and which filesystem you're using. For instance, some flavors of Linux have a 2GiB max filesize, unless the various programs are compiled with special options. The BSDs, on the other hand, can (mostly) deal with TiB sized files gracefully - except some programs (still) assume that you only can have a maximum size of 2 GiB. So, in short - 2GiB is the least-common-denominator of 'max file size', but most modern Unices can deal with bigger. At least some of the time. :)"
