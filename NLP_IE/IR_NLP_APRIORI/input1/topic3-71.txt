Do schools need better teachers or more funding? Why?,"Both, and neither. Schools need better support for their current teachers to help them become better. There's an over 50% turnover rate of new teachers in the first year. A little high, don't you think? A lot of it is about administrative and group support, new teachers a lot of times are thrown to the wolves. Better support a lot of times doesn't exist because the funding isn't there for teacher development, so it's a catch-22."
