How many words with 10 letters are there in the US dictionary?,"SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) has about 70,000 10-letter words total. If we limit it to the large subset recommended for spellchecking in the U.S., it's about 20,000 10-letter words. If we then remove proper names, capitalized words, abbreviations, contractions, and possessives, it's about 14,000 words (from abandoning to zygodactyl). Scrabble dictionaries usually have considerably fewer 10-letter words, because they remove words that can't be formed in normal gameplay. The one I have lists about 50 10-letter words."
