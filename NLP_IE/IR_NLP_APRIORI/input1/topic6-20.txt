Honeymoon Destinations: Greece vs. Hawaii in March. Any Suggestions?,"We were in Maui last March for our Honeymoon. We had a wonderful time. It is less crowded because it isn't peak season, but nothing was closed. The whales are very active at that time, so whenever we looked out at the ocean we could see a splash or a fluke or a breech. It was wonderful and romantic. Especially when we were on the beach taking photos for the wedding and there was a huge splash against the sunset-- everyone on the beach ooh'd and ahh'd. But the sun wasn't always out, so we weren't on the beach everyday. That was okay with me because there is too mcuh to explore anyways. The trip around the island to Hana was gorgeous with tropical blue water crashing against black lava rocks. It is a very easy, laid-back place. Wonderful for a honeymoon, I think. Good luck!"
