"i am taking a red-eye Friday (Oct 14th 2005) night, and get to Boston 7am. I would like to find a place that I can take a shower before I am giving a talk at 10am. Web search does not yeild much useful. Any clue much appreciated. PS, I have a rental car, so places away from the Airport is also fine, as long as it's within reasonable driving distance, e.g, 20 miles.","I don't know what airline you're flying but some of the airline lounges will likely have these facilities. The American Airlines Admiral's Club in Logan, for instance, has showers (see url below).    If you are not an Admiral's Club member, they do allow you to purchase a one-day pass to access their facilities.     Additionally, Logan also runs some spa/gym facilities in conjunction with hotels. For instance the Hilton Boston Logan Airport, has gym/spa facilities that you could also use--though you likely have to pay some sort of one-day access pass.    Hope this helps!"
