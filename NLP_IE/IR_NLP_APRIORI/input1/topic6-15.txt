I am using United Airline's mileage credit card. Not sure if it is good or not.,"I used to have one, but canceled because it didn't do me much good. The best way to earn miles for United is still to fly a lot. After about a year of using the credit card (and charging it a lot), I still did not make it past a general member. Slap on the $75 annual fee, and it wasn't worth it.    Capital One is promoting their no blackout dates on any airline pretty agressively--I'd check that out."
