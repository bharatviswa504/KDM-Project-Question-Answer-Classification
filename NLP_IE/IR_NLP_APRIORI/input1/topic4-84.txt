And how long was it on the market?,"After New Coke was introduced in 1985, there was a huge outcry among Coke drinkers that forced the company to reintroduce the original formula (rebranded Classic Coke) after just two months. New Coke was eventually renamed Coke II (not to be confused with the more recent C2) and had a tiny market share for a few years. It apparently is no longer sold in the U.S., although it is still listed as one of the company's brands. The Snopes article below has a very detailed history of the New Coke fiasco (also debunking the myth that the whole thing was done on purpose)."
