"Complicated question: Here goes. <br><br>I currently live in NYC (with wife and kids), and won't be moving out to California until December, even though I began working at Yahoo in April (I'm commuting every week x-country). <br><br>I say that as background because my 95 year old grandfather in New Haven, CT just decided to give me his old car (a 2002 Toyota of some kind). Until we move out to California, however, we're going to be parking it my wife's sister's in Stamford Connecticut. <br><br>So here's the question: Can I register the car now in California or do I have to wait until it has physically arrived in the state? <br><br>And if not, how much extra is it going to cost me to register now in New Haven and then to reregister it again in California? If the additional money is significant, we'll probably just wait until we come to California, because we have very little need to use the car until then. <br><br>Hope that all made sense.",i've done that recently. the car must be physically located in california. they needto inspect it and such.    btw - you have to do that a month or so after you get it in the state or you get a fine.
