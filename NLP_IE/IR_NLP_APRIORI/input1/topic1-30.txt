Who are AMG's competitors?,"AMG's competitors are the BMW M series (m3, m5, m6) and audi's s series (s4, s6, s8, rs4, rs6, rs8). Also, Cadillac is coming up with some worthy competition with their V-Series. (sts-v, cts-v, xlr-v)    In general AMG tends to be more balanced on the comfort scale than BMW. They are brutally fast but also very easy to drive and comfortable. For instance all AMG vehicles are automatic transmission whereas all BMW's use either a manual or a sequential manual transmission. Audi is in between. S vehicles are available in both manual and auto versions. Cadillac tends to be more on the sport side as well."
