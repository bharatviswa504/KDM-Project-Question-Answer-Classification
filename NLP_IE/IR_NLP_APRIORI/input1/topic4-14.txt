Is there an easy way to learn how to use chopsticks?,"Try this method from ehow. Don't be afraid to try what works--as long as you can pick up food, you're good.    1. Hold one chopstick between your thumb and middle finger. Position the chopstick so that it lies at the base of your thumb (on the joint) and at the lower joint of the middle finger. This chopstick shouldn't touch the forefinger.  2. Place the other chopstick between your thumb and forefinger. The side of the chopstick should rest against the tip of your thumb; the top of the chopstick should rest against the pad of your forefinger.  3. Be sure the tips of the chopsticks are parallel.  4. Keep the first chopstick stationary as you practice moving the second chopstick toward the stationary one.  5. Use this technique to position the chopsticks around a piece of food.  6. Hold the food firmly as you lift it toward your mouth."
