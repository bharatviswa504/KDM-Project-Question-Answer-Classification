"for about one week stay, including airfare, and overwater or beach bungalow stay, around Feb 2006","Me and my wife went to a multi-island Polynesia visit - Tahiti, Huahine, Moorea & Bora Bora. It was incredible! Probably my favoritte place on earth but then again it was our honeymoon. I planned exactly what I wanted by reviewing packages from Tahiti Legends and a few others companies (I have the info at home and will look it up...) but what I ended up doing is booking with CostCo travel which offered the lowest overall price for the exact same product!"
