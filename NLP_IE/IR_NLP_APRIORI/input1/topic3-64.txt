Should high schools offer classes on SAT for all?,"I'd say yes, all high schools should offer SAT test prep. The main two reasons: 1) Workers 18 and over with a bachelorâ€™s degree earn an average of $51,206 a year, while those with a high school diploma earn $27,915. (U.S. Census Bureau). Basically, college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. This increased income provides more security, support to raise a family, and the means for furthering ones education. 2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree."
