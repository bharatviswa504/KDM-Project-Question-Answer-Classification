There are a lot of proposals out there-- from just scrapping the whole city to turning it into a floating canal city like Venice. What should happen to New Orleans?,"It should be rebuilt of course,,, but the question is where and how? It should be rebuilt in a way to protect the city from future disasters. Possibly keeping the historic parts of the city as much as possible as a historical or tourist attraction and moving the other vulnerable parts of the city to safer locations."
