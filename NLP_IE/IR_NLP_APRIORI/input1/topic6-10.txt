Can you make a day trip out of visiting the Hoover Dam from Las Vegas? Anything else to do there,"You can go to Lake Mead Recreation Park along with the Hoover dam.    You can also have a 5 hour ride and go to the Grand Canyon, but if you are planning on getting back to Las Vegas on the same day then it makes it a very long day. There are bus tours that take you to the Grand Canyon, so you donâ€™t really have to drive"
