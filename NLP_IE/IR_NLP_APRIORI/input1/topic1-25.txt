"I've heard that some Subaru engines are very prone to head gasket failure. If I have bubbles in my coolant reservoir (so many that it overflows coolant -- even when it's not overfilled) does that mean I have a bad head gasket? Also, the temp gage started rising very quickly while in line at a toll booth... but dropped immediately when I upped the engine rpm to move forward (just a few feet and at low speed, so it wasn't airflow past the radiator). No white smoke from the tailpipe.","I think that may be a sign of a blown headgasket. I think if that might be the case the best thing to try is to check the oil to see if any coolant has gotten into it(I think its a brownish milky color if it has), and also maybe check the coolant to see if any oil has gotten into it. Other things you might check are. check under the car to see if coolant is leaking somewhere. It might just be a leak, check the hoses to see if they are wet. changing a hose is quite a bit cheaper than changing a headgasket. those are some things that are easy to do before going under the gun to replacing the headgasket."
