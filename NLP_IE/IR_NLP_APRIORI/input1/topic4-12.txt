Why is red wine good for your heart?,"Studies show that drinking two to three glasses of red wine daily is good for the heart.     The antioxidants properties in red wine lowers the risk of heart disease. However, there is still no proof that consuming antioxidants actually lowers the risk of heart and artery disease.     Besides drinking red wine daily, there are other ways to reduce heart disease. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables and fish, and reduced intake of milk products can reduce the risk of heart disease."
