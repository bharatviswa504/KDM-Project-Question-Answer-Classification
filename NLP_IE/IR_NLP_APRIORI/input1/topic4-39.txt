How do you make iced coffee?,"1. Brew a pot of fresh coffee. If you're making the coffee just to be iced, prepare a slightly stronger blend than usual to account for ice melting later.  2. Transfer the desired amount to a carafe or pitcher.  3. Let stand at room temperature for 3 to 5 hours, or refrigerate for 1 1/2 to 3 hours.  4. Fill a 10- to 12-oz. glass with ice cubes.  5. Pour the chilled coffee into the glass.  6. Stir the coffee to equalize its temperature. Add milk if you like."
