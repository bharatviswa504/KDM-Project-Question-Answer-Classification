"I read that those with this distinction are able to identify vintage, varietal, etc of wines on tasting and that becoming a Master of Wine is very difficult to achieve. How does one become a master of wine? What credentials do they have? And what resources are at their disposal for their wine education--presumably not everyone can afford or have the opportunity to taste rare wines, etc.","Master of Wine is an internationally recognised qualification (MW) conferred by The Institute of Masters of Wine, founded in 1955 and based in the United Kingdom. The qualification is achieved through extensive examination and dissertation, and is generally regarded in the wine industry as setting an extremely high standard of professional knowledge.     Before being allowed to enroll for the two-year program, potential candidates must persuade the Institute that they have the necessary aptitude by submitting an essay and tasting notes. In addition, they must be interviewed by, and obtain the mentoring of, an existing Master of Wine.     Candidates must sit both the theory (four papers) and practical (three blind tastings) parts of the examination in the same year. If they achieve success in only one part, however, they may attempt the remaining part in the subsequent two years. If successful at the examination stage, candidates must then write and submit a dissertation within six months of approval of a synopsis by the Institute's Education and Examination Board.     The Institute states that over the seven year period up to 2000, of the 266 candidates who undertook the programme a total of 85 were successful in passing all parts of the examination and becoming Masters of Wine."
