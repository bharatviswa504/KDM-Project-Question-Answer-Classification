"How can teachers, parents and administrators improve test scores for middle school children?","I believe the best answer to your question is less obvious than what happens in the classroom or at home while children are in the process of learning. We (meaning the US) have gone a little bit overboard in trying to quantify academic progress, although some measurement is valuable. It's just been corrupted in recent years for political purposes to convince us we're making progress in how we stack up nationally. In any case, I'd suggest getting students at ease in the standardized test taking environment. Give them some experience before test days with time constraints and answer grids. For goodness sake, don't make a test seem like the whole future of the school district is dependent on their performance! Talk about test anxiety! Perhaps counselors have a role too in helping students who appear to be stressed by the experience with a few relaxation techniques. Your mind works like a file system, and the lower the stress, the more you are able to recall from the material that you actually do know."
