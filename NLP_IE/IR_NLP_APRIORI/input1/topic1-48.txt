Does the Fix-A-Flat product really work? Does it do any damage?,"It essentially destroys the inside of your tire in order to plug the hole, by chemically bonding with the rubber in the tire.. If you use Fix-A-Flat, basically you should count on buying a new tire instead of patching the hole. Also, since many forms of debris remain in the tire, fix-a-flat can trick you into thinking your tire is ok while there is a nail or something doing even more damage. Changing a tire is extremely simple to do and if you practice it once you'll be surprised at how easy it is."
