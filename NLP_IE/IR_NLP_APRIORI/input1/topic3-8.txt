What is the history behind it?,"here is what the Net has to offer:    http://signalfan.freeservers.com/history.html    As early as the mid-1800's, the railroads in both England and the United States were using lanterns, hung from crossbars, to give railroad men a signal visible by night as well as by day. For the control or direction of street traffic by colored lights however, England appears to have led the way. The worlds first traffic signal using colored lights was installed in December of 1868 at the intersection of George and Bridge Streets near the Houses of Parliament. It had been installed in response to a suggestion by a select committee that railway signal gear be adapted to street traffic. It's purpose was to give protection to members of Parliament and lesser street crossers at a point where vehicle traffic was very heavy.      The resulting signal was invented by J.P. Knight, a railroad signaling engineer. Shown here by a surviving drawing, it was to have been an imposing 22' high and crowned with a gas light. The semaphore arms, when extended horizontally, meant Stop. When lowered to a droopy 45Â° angle, meant Caution. At night, a green light and red light were used in conjunction with the arms.    Although it is entirely possible and probable that other attempts were made to control traffic by colored lights after this London experience, no recorded account has come down to us until the earlier part of the 20th century..    you can also refer to:   http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2004/Projects/J0332.pdf#search='red%20is%20stop%20green%20is%20go%20history'"
