"For a podcasting application, I'd like my web server to be able to receive audio straight from the browser. Something like a Push to talk button. It seems it's possible to do this with Flash. Is there any other way? With Flash, do I need to buy a Macromedia server licence, or are there alternatives to have Flash on the browser talk to my server?",Userplane has an audio/video recorder that will do that - you can check it out at http://www.userplane.com/apps/videoRecorder.cfm
