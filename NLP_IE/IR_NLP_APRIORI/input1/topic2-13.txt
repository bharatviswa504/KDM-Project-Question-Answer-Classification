I'm thinking about starting my own search engine and wondering how to make money off of it. Would a paid inclusion program be a good idea?,"No I don't think so. It seems to be a better bet to come up with a system to bid on keywords, like Google & Yahoo Search Marketing (formerly Overture). P4P is a better system than PI."
