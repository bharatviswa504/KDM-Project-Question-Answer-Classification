"I've used Adium/Fire on Macintosh Trillian on Windows Is there any software that runs on Mac, Windows AND Linux that can provide encrypted Yahoo/AIM chat? Skype is its own network, and not AIM/Yahoo.","The easiest way to have an encrypted conversation between any platform is probably to use a jabber server that supports SSL. jabber.org supports SSL, and clients are freely available for every platform. Adium for Mac is a good client, Gaim for Linux, and Gaim or Trillian for Windows should cover most of your needs using that combination."
