Which are the best K-12 public schools in the SF Bay area?,"it depends on what you're looking for.    Cupertino district has some of the best test scores, but the flavor of the classes and homework is very intense. creativity is not promoted, but instead repetitive training and exercises are encouraged. Some people find this stifling, but this district is VERY popular especially with people of asian origin.    Neighboring Saratoga has similar or better scores, but the corriculum encourages much more diversity and creativity.    Palo Alto has a mixture of very good and average schools, so it depends which ones you get in to. The flavor is generally similar to Saratoga, and maybe a tad less competitive.    Another district to consider is Los Altos, the main problem there is that the high school is not very good.    The attached URL will give you very good insight into the scores and quality of the schools as well as demographics, but unfortunately very little insight into the flavor of each."
