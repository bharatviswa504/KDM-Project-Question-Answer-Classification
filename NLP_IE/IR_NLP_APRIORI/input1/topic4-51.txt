How to make good spanish rice?,"My mom makes her Spanish rice this way and she got it from recipezaar site.    1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes   1 1/2 cups chicken stock   1 1/4 cups rice   1 tablespoon butter or margarine   2 teaspoons chili powder   3/4 teaspoon oregano   1/2 teaspoon garlic salt   1 teaspoon cumin     In medium saucepan, combine all ingredients (I usually mash tomatoes with potato masher or give them a quick spin in food processor).     Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low.     Cover and simmer 25 minutes or until rice is done. (Unless you like sticky, gooey rice, don't take off the lid and stir at all until it is done).     Garnish with green onions and/or cheddar cheese."
