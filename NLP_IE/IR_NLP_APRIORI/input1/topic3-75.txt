Why is SAT important?,"Most colleges and universities use your SAT score as a factor in determining admissions. While it may be possible to get a waiver in some cases, your chances at consideration are much greater if you take the SAT.     Another reason to take the SAT is for financial aid consideration. Grants and scholarships, especially those run by the school or private organizations, often take SAT scores along with grade point average into account."
