What are the places to see while in Perth?,"Fremantle and it's pubs/clubs, Cottesloe Beach (with a pub at the beach), Kings Park (on the Swan River), The Quokkas on Rottnest Island, The Pinnacles at Nanbung national park, A Sunday session at the North Shore or Cottesloe, A night in Northbridge, Margaret River (to the south), Kalbarri (a long way to the north), Monkey Mia (even more of a long way to the north), and lastly if you're interested in WA's goldmining history a 1 hour flight to Kalgoorlie is worth thinking about. You'll find these and other things to do and see at: http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/ Update: Since you have extended the deadline on this question, maybe you should add some more detail about the type of things you are looking to do in Perth."
