Is chocolate milk good for kids? Will drinking chocolate milk make them hyper?,"Chocolate milk is good for kids and it tastes good too. Like white milk, it provides the same essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, potassium, phosphorus, riboflavin and niacin. The difference between chocolate milk and white milk is only about 60 calories, which fits into a growing child's total diet.       Sugar does not cause hyperactivity or mood swings in children. Also, the tiny amount of caffeine in chocolate milk is too small to affect most children. The amount of caffeine in chocolate milk is similar to decaffeinated drinks. Colas may contain up to ten times more caffeine than chocolate milk."
