What does BMW stand for?,"BMW was originally (in 1917) the initials for Bayerische Motoren Werke, which means Bavarian Motor Works. These days, the corporation seems to be just called BMW Group. (They use this name even on the German language version of their web site.)    Incidentally, the way Germans pronounce BMW sounds something like bay-em-vay in English."
