What's the best way to heat up a cold hamburger (In & Out)?,"If you must eat a heated In & Out hamburger then I suggest the follow:  First, scrape the ketchup, mayo and any other sauce that is on the hamburger and put it a side. Also take the vegetables out.  Second, pre-heat a steak pan; put the hamburger separate form the bun on the hot pan  Third, heat up both parts of the bun near the hamburger on the same hot pan (you can get some souce from the hamburger on it)  Fourth, you can either put back the original ketchup, mayo and the vegetables or, better yet, get new ones from what you have at home .
