What does cleansing the palate mean?,"Cleansing the palate is most common in wine tasting, however it also used in fine dining. It involves clearing your mouth of any previous taste before trying the next item.    With wine, tasters will try one and then before trying the next one they will have a drink of water and a piece of bread. This is done so that they can judge the next wine completely on its own (without having the taste of the previous wine in their mouth).    The same concept could apply to fine dining where a person wants to fully indulge in each course without having the taste of the previous course still in their mouth."
