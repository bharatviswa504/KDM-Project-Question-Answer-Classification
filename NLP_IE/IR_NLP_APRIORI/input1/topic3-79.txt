What is paraphrasing?,"Paraphrasing is when you put someone else's ideas in your own words. It's not just rewriting a paragraph or changing a few words. From the webs ite below: Paraphrasing is: *your own rendition of essential information and ideas expressed by someone else, presented in a new form. *one legitimate way (when accompanied by accurate documentation) to borrow from a source. *a more detailed restatement than a summary, which focuses concisely on a single main idea. Be careful about taking a sentence and only changing a few words in it--some plagarism detecting software will catch that and call it plagarism."
