I'll be in Bangkok for a week. What are the places that I should not miss seeing?,"Wat Arun - Temple of dawn. (Gaze at the temples and buildings patterned using broken pottery). Along the Chao Phrya river, which FYI connects to China, you can see the king's boats - used to cruise down the river himself. I believe the Leornado DiCaprio Movie, The Beach features Khao San Road. This place is famous simply because it's full of nightlife, things to do, many others all down a road. It's in the city's center. Enjoy your trip."
