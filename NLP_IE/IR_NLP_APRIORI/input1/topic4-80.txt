Are there any tricks to peeling a butternut squash?,"If you can, cook it first. the skin peels away very easily after it's been roasted (better to roast than boil). If you need to cut up into chunks for sauteeing or something, do this: 1. Cut lengthwise, and then into quarters. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise again if very large (should look like watermelon slices). 2. Take sharp knife parallel to cutting surface and place right between skin and flesh. 3. Run knife along the bottom and remove flesh from the skin. Place hand on top of squash flesh to keep pressure on. 4. cut up into cubes or whatever shape. And remember it should feel more like running the squash along the knife, than moving a knife through the squash. Small difference, but results in fewer cuts."
