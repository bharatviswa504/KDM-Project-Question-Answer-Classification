"My friend bought a bottle of wine and on the back label, it said something about malolactic fermentation. What does it mean?","Here's a good answer to your question that I found in mainbrace website:    After grapes are picked in the vineyard, they are crushed, then fermented and aged, and then bottled. During fermentation, yeasts turn much of the sugar in the crushed grapes to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Between the fermentation stage and aging, many winemakers subject the wine to another step: malolactic fermentation.     During this step the malic acid present in the wine is converted to lactic acid. This has the effect of reducing the sharpness of the wine and introducing a smooth, sometimes even buttery flavour. (Lactic acid is the acid present in milk and milk products.)    Why do winemakers do this? Although the process has been known for some time, it is only within the last twenty years or so that the demand for easy-drinking, approachable wines has led wineries to strive for smoother wines that can be consumed with comfort without long aging to mellow out their flavours."
