How do I get a sticker off of a car window (plastic part)? Nail polish remover seems risky?,"Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue. Soak the area, and wipe it away. It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.    Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic. I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful.     In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape. Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly. Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it. This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective."
