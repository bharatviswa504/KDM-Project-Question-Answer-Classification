"What's a better car, a Camry or an Accord?","The Accord. Objectively the Accord just won the comparison test in the latest Car and Driver (camry came in last), and subjectively Honda is a much more innovative and interesting company than Toyota. For instance, the Accord has a racing derived double wishbone suspension at all four corners, resulting in a car with sharper handling than the camry. The Accord has also been mildly restyled for 2006, which in my opinion is a BIG improvement over the previous model. The gauges in the honda are electroluminiscent, which is immediately apparent when starting the car. The keys are RFID encoded to prevent theft. The navigation system is voice activated and one of the best on the market. THere really is no comparison between the two. Of course, drive them both, but the innovation is clearly with Honda in this comparison."
