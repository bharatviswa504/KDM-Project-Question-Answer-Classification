"I would like to purchase a BMW, should I upgrade to the sports package?","The simple answer is if you have to ask, probably not :) The Sport Package offers more supportive seats and a more aggressive wheel and tire package and suspension. The upsides are better handling and appearance(highly subjective), but tires will be more expensive and the ride will be harsher. Test drive both and see which you prefer. On the other hand, sport package models are highly sought after but the increased resale value probably doesn't offset the cost of purchase, so if you get it, get it for yourself and not the next owner ;)"
