The car is on the verge of being out of warranty and looking for a shop to do minor service like oil changes and Inspection I/II and more involved repairs like swapping out radiators and hose replacements.,"Phil, I highly recommend D&M Motors in Palo Alto for Audi, Porsche, BMW. They are very honest and good, I've been going for years. they have helped me troubleshoot and fix some probs on my A4 that have confounded other mechanics, going the extra mile to do so. number is 1.650.329.9016."
