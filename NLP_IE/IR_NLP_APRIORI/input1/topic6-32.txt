"In Paris, is it worth it to purchase a museum pass or should I just pay individually?","Totally worth it, at least for the restrooms. :) The museum pass doesn't get you in to absolutely everything (that'd be another good q&a), but it gets you in to most everything. Additionally, it lets you skip the line to buy tickets in a lot of places - for example, we got to skip the line at Versailles, St. Chappelle, and Musee d'Orsay. It's also pretty nice to be able to go into (almost) any museum, if even for a brief while. We had a nice time spending a few hours in d'Orsay, then going to the Rodin museum for an hour, Invalides for 30 minutes, so on. It's nice that you can go sample a lot of different places, at least briefly. And, honestly, sometimes you go into the museum just to find a good restroom."
