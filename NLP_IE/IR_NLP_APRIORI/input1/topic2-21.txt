"Which is better, Mac or PC?","I vote for the Mac. a) I think the Mac is easier to use b) the Mac tends to be more secure than the PC. c) The Mac hardware tends to be better (if you believe Consumer Reports and depending on the maker) d) Mac tech support tends to be better (if you believe Consumer Reports and depending on the maker) I would argue that the upfront price isn't that crucial, because you may end up paying money for assistance to fix your PC or paying with your time to fix your PC. I've heard of people's PC's so badly infected with spyware and viruses, that they've just junked the computer and bought a new one. By the way, don't compare Macs to PC based on Clock speed. The Clockspeeds aren't directly comparable."
