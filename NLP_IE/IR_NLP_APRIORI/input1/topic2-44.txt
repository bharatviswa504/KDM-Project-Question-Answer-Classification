"First it's the one-click stuff, and now it's consumer reviews. Do they have a legal leg to stand on?","Amazon, like other companies, tries to patent its innovations for two reasons: 1. To gain a competitive advantage by excluding competitors from using its new ideas. For example, Amazon once sued Barnes and Noble over a patent. 2. To discourage competitors from filing patent infringement suits against Amazon. This concept is sometimes called Mutually Assured Destruction. The idea that Amazon or other companies are patenting existing or obvious ideas is incorrect. It's an urban legend fueled by people's unwillingness to read and understand the patents. The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) only grants patents on techniques that are *novel* and *non-obvious*. You can look up any granted US patent on the USPTO website, and roughly evaluate it by reading the broadest independent claim, which is usually claim #1. Remember, to infringe the claim, you have to have all the elements of the claim. Generally, the claims are narrower (less powerful) than people think. Do they have a legal leg to stand on? Once a patent is gratned by the USPTO, it has roughly a 50% chance of being upheld if brought to court."
