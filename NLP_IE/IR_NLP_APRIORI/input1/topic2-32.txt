How do you find the web site traffic (number of page views) for a particular web site?,"Alexa's traffic rankings are a good way to get relative metrics for a site that you're not in control of. Be aware however that their numbers only reflect the group of people that have the Alexa toolbar installed on their computers. Here is Yahoo's listing: http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&compare_sites=&y=p&q=&url=yahoo.com If you are the owner of the site, you can take your webserver logs and run them through an analyzer such as awtats - http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"
