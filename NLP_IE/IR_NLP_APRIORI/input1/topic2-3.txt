what is the best photo slideshow creation application,"I recently tried two products to create an end-of-the-season slideshow for my childrens swim team, MyDVD 6.1 from Sonic Solution and PictureShow 3 from ULead.    The first product, MyDVD 6.1 was easy to use, but had an unacceptable flaw and was missing a really great feature. When creating long slideshows (>99 slides), the software automatically created chapter points. The problem was, that the audio would drop out at each chapter, creating unpleasant silence at seemingly random intervals in the show (~4-5x during my slide show). Since their customer support had no recommendations on solving the problem, I was forced to look elsewhere.    The second product PictureShow 3 from Ulead, not only solved that problem, but added a feature that I really think is a must have. The feature, known as the Ken Burns effect, subtly zooms or pans the photo within the frame during playback. This allows a slide show to have a sense of motion. Everyone that viewed the DVD I created universally liked the effect and commented on the cool factor.    The UI for adding multiple audio tracks could be improved, but it does allow frame level control over positioning the audio. The DVD burning process on a large number of 8MP photos took about an hour for 260 photos, which was longer than MyDVD took for a similar task. The project templates and menu backgrounds provided for both products were a bit weak for my taste, so I used a custom background for my main menu.    All-in-all PictureShow 3 did a great job for me. The slide show was a great success and the audience of ~200-300 people who viewed it at the end of the season were impressed by the quality and I got numerous positive comments."
