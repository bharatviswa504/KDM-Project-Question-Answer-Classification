what is the best lap top to get with reasonable price?,"I've had mostly Toshiba's for the past five years, they are rock solid reliable. Check out Amazon to skip taxes and shipping. You can also add Toshiba support to a laptop you bought on Amazon, their tech's are great. The few HP's I've worked with (including my Yahoo! work laptop) seem very feature rich, but I've never owned one long enough to determine how reliable they are. HP does seem to be hitting the street hard this Christmas season with low prices; they had a Black Friday special laptop for $400 at Wal-Mart. Their screens also seem very crisp and high resolution, there's definately a sexy factor. I like the look and pricing of the new Dells, but my IT admin friends have had plenty of problems with older Dell keyboards breaking, so I'd make sure to add a service plan to your Dell if you're comparison shopping the price."
