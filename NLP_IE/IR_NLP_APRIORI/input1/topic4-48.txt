"Do I have to stick with red wine - red meat, or can I mix it up? Are their certain types of meat that go well with lighter wines?","The red wine rule only goes for heavier meats like steak or lamb.  Spicy meat dishes, like Indian and Hunan entrees, are best accompanied by white wine or beer. Pork, the other white meat, can be accompanied by white wine. Chicken and turkey go well with less heavy reds like pinot noir. Because duck is very rich, it can hold up next to a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Merlot.    When dining out, I ask my server for recommended wine pairings with the menu items. Some restaurants list the suggested accompaniments for you. Take note of the pairings you like so you can serve them yourself at home."
