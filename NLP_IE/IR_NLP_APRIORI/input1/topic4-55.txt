How and why do you decant a wine?,"You decant a wine to separate clear wine from sediment, to mix oxygen in to an ageworthy wine that is being opened while immature, and for aesthetics.    When you do decant a wine, the method differs depending on your purpose.     If you're decanting to avoid sediment, you must pour the wine gently from the bottle to the decanter, making sure not to shake the bottle or pick it up and put it down repeatedly. This way, the sediment will stay at the bottom of the bottle and not mix into the wine.     If you're decanting to breathe an immature wine, you should pour vigorously, with the idea of splashing as much air as possible into the wine."
