I never took trig. Is it the level after calculus?,"In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.    In the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full AP Calculus, where the AP stands for Advanced Placement and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."
