"Tremas (diaeresis) are normally used to indicate that the (second) vowel is pronounced in a separate syllable, which indeed makes sense in co√∂peration, however, The New Yorker seems to be the only publication in the English speaking world which does so? Why? Are there other publishers?","It seems to be a stylistic holdover from an era when that usage was more prevalent (about the 1930s/1940s). The New Yorker has a highly entrenched writing style that has been rigorously enforced over the years. (For example, there was a staff Grammarian who overlooked much of the copy editing for over fifty years; see the below article for details.) In short, the writing style/voice has become as much a trademark of the magazine as its cartoons, and will most likely not be changing much in the foreseeable future."
