What is the single most important thing you are missing on the internet ?,"I think that the best thing about the internet is that you CAN be anonymous. I agree that there should be a single identity that a user can use in secured web sites, like banks, but I prefer it to be an identity specific to the category and not to the entire internet. Meaning, if you look at the FICO number and what affect it (being late in the supermarket affect you car insurance) I rather not repeat that in the internet world. So my suggestion is to have separate identity to separate categories – the Banks’ web site will have their own identity database and it will be a different one form the gambling industry, etc."
