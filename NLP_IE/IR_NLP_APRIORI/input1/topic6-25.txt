"looking for a cheap hotel + airfare for new years eve ...since we will be barely spending time in the hotel, a decent (livable) hotel with decent rooms.....somewhere on the strip... pls suggest...",Well.. depend on your definition of cheap. The cheapest hotel I could find that's located on las vegas blvd is around $150 at Mirage. This is cheap enough for me considering the timing in Christmas.
