which is the largest lake in the United States?,"I'll assume that when you write largest that you are referring to the surface area of the lake. Superior is the largest lake that's partly in the United States at 31,820 square miles. The largest lake entirely contained in the United States is Lake Michigan, 22,400 square miles. Excluding the great lakes, the Great Salt Lake in Utah is the largest lake in the USA at 1700 square miles. There is a little bit of controversy, as some believe that Lake Michigan and Luke Huron are really one lake at 45,410 square miles. So, depending on who you ask, the answer could be the bi-national Lake Michigan/ Lake Huron, the bi-national Lake Superior, the possibly-only-half-a-lake Lake Michigan or the Great Salt Lake. You could even take it a step further-- if you consider Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to be one lake, you only want to consider lakes entirely within the United States, and you want to restrict it to fresh water lakes, you'd have to look further. Lake Iliamna is the next in line at 1000 square miles. But it's in Alaska, so if you restrict yourself to the 48 contiguous states, you need to cast a wider net still. Lake Okeechobee is next at 700 square miles-- but it's really more of a swamp. So you may want to look even further to Lake Champlain at 490 square miles. So take your pick-- Michigan/Huron, Superior, Michigan, Great Salt, Iliamna, Okeechobee or Champlain!"
