Why won't George Bush meet with Cindy Sheehan?,"Because he is not aware of the responsibilities of being the President of the US. Bush has made a long history of ignoring the obvious for his own personal gain and arrogance. When things get bad, he has historically veered away from dealing weith things and people responsibly and run home to hide under his extravagant bed. Last time the walls were caving he 'found' Jesus. But Cindy is far too complex for his thought patterns to deal with. He'll meet with Tom, wacko preachers, torturing dictators, but cannot open his presidential door to a citizen and a taxpayer."
