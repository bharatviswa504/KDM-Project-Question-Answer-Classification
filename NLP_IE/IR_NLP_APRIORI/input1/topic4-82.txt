Why do people put salt around the glass when drinking Margarita?,"Salt is traditionally added to the rim of the glass to provide a sharp contrast in flavor to better experience the drink as a whole. The difference in the salt and the sugar content in the alcohol helps to stimulate all of your tastebuds, which are divided into sectors based on the type of sensation. Take caution to not over-salt the rim of the glass and thus coat only the outside portion of the rim around 1/4... getting salt on the inside of the glass risks modifying the flavor of the drink."
