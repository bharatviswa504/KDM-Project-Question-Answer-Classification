How do I make fluffy scrambled eggs?,"According to Food Network, use milk to make fluffier scrambled eggs.     Here's a recipe from the Food Network Kitchens site:    Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk in the milk. Season the eggs with salt and beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until combined. Over-beating makes the eggs thin. As the eggs cook, the milk turns into steam, puffing up the eggs as they firm. The traces of sugar, fats and protein in the milk also help to make larger curds. The larger the curds, the more steam is trapped. Water will dilute the flavor and they will not be as soft and fluffy. Don’t add more than five teaspoons of milk per egg, because the eggs can’t absorb all that milk.     Cook the eggs in a heavy nonstick pan or a well-seasoned pan to prevent the eggs from sticking. Don’t use too large a pan either, or the batter will spread out and cook too quickly. An eight-inch pan works well for two eggs, a 10-inch pan for four eggs. Preheating the pan over a medium heat also keeps the eggs from sticking.     Add butter or oil – about a teaspoon per egg – and heat it. Add the eggs and let them begin to set; then, with a heatproof rubber spatula, push the curds to one side and let the uncooked eggs spread over the surface of the pan. Repeat this action until the eggs are cooked to the desired degree of doneness – eggs taste best when slightly moist."
