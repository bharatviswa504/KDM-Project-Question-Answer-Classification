Can you recommend a good preschool with childcare around New York?,"You don't specify-- do you mean around Manhattan? The Urban Baby message boards are a good and very active source of information: http://newyork.urbanbaby.com/community/messageboards_main.html I also like the GoCityKids site: http://www.gocitykids.com/?area=197 I'd recommend contacting moms in your area for recommendations, and touring schools that are near your home. (GCK can help you find one in your neighborhood.) Here's a nationwide roundup of childcare websites: http://www.babycenter.com/refcap/baby/babychildcare/6104.html"
