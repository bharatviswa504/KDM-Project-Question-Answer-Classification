All the major things are taken care of but I want to help in some way. Give me a recipe for something complementary to typical thanksgiving fare that will wow my guests.,"I like Polenta with sun dried tomatoes and chipotle as a side dish. It is really quick to make (About 15 min.)and tastes and looks great. Step 1: Make Polenta. I typically take 1 part polenta (corn meal) and 3 parts water and put it in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. About halfway through you should stir it. It will be soft and creamy. Step 2: When the polenta is done, you add chopped sundried tomatoes and some Chipotle sause (I get mine at Trader Joes). The more chipotle the spicier the dish will be. You can eat it right away, or let it sit for a while to cool off and harden. Step 3 (optional) Once it is hard, you can cut it in slices, and quickly brown them under the broiler right before serving."
