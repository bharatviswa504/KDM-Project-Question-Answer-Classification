How can we make teaching more attractive to young people?,"Higher salaries- for the amount of education that a teacher has to have, their pay is a pittance. What other careers do you know where people with a master's degree in their chosen field start out around $35,000/ year, or less? The pay level is ridiculous- so low that teachers usually can not live on their salaries unless they are married to someone else who works, or have a second job. Second, reduce the workload. Most don't realize that a teacher's workday is not limited to 8 hours or so they are at school. When you add in the lesson planning and grading that must be done on your own time, the constant parent conferences, meetings, paperwork and evaluations, and training sessions that they throw at you, you're normally working the equivalent of 10-12 hour days, and filling up your entire weekends with it. Then add in more trainings and classes that they require you to take during your vacation times, and there's practically no break. Third- allow them to teach!! So much of the time is taken up with madated tests, evaluations, and forced mucky muck that teaching doesn't get to happen anywhere near as often as it should. And lastly- give teachers a break! Literally. Breaks are few and far between and dreadful are the times when you have to go and can't because there is no one else to watch your class. In short, teachers need help in a lot of ways."
