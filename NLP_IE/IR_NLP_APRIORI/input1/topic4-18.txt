My boyfriend doesn't like food with fish sauce.,"It depends on what you're trying to make. If you're talking about straight up fish sauce, soy will work in a pinch, since both are salty. If you're talking about Vietnamese Nuoc Mam, you're better off trying something else, since any substitute will taste like fish sauce and is unlikely to be acceptable to your boyfriend. Sorry."
