recently in the market for a bbq. curious as to the pros and cons of using gas vs charcoal.,"I say Charcoal ! ,but here are the pros and cons for charcoal and gas grills    Charcoal Pros    Food tastes better. That smoked flavor is impossible to duplicate with gas even if you buy the smoke products.     Charcoal grills are less expensive. A quality charcoal grill runs between $50 and $100.     It's easy to find portable charcoal grills to take on trips.    Cooking over charcoal becomes an event. If family members get hooked on cooking over charcoal, they will enjoy playing around with different techniques.     Charcoal Cons    Starting a fire can be a problem especially on damp or rainy days. It does help to keep the charcoal good and dry and an electric firestarter can also be used.    It's easy to burn food over charcoal. The heat is regulated with vents, and the cook must know how to use the vents and lid to keep the fire from flaring or burning too hot.     Coals must cool before the grill can be cleaned. This can take several hours.    A charcoal grill is messy. Grease, charcoal and ashes are not the easiest things to clean up.    Gas Pros    Starting a gas grill is as easy as turning on the gas and pushing a button. Do be careful and follow directions.    Flames and temperatures can be fine tuned with the settings on a gas grill. If you have recipes that call for temperature settings and times, then gas is super simple.    Most gas grills have two sides with separate controls, so it's easy to cook two different things at once even if they require different amounts of heat.     Clean up is really easy.    Gas Cons    Food cooked on a gas grill does not have charcoal flavor no matter what you do.    Gas grills cost more. Expect to pay at least $100 for a good gas grill. Some run in the thousands.    Most gas grills are large and are hard to take on trips.    If you run out of gas, you're out of luck"
