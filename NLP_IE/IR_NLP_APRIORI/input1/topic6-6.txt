I hoped to get in the Mission Ranch Resort for my anniversary but they're sold out for one of the nights I need. Anyone have a suggestion?,"The best high end hotels are Post Ranch Inn and the Ventana Inn, just south of Carmel. The Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Inn at Spanish Bay are also luxurious hotels near Carmel. The Highlands Inn in Carmel is more reasonably priced but less romantic/intimate. The Tickle Pink Inn is even more moderately priced and has great views"
