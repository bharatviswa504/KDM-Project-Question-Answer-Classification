I had a hard time trying to figure out what my security key was. I don't even remember ever having one.,"Yahoo! Help You can get a new password, a Yahoo! ID reminder, or both. Visit the Sign-in Problems page (http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_forgot_pw?new=1&.done=&.src=&partner=&.intl=us) and supply some basic verification information, such as your birthday and the ZIP or postal code you provided when you registered. Make sure to provide the same information you gave during registration or when you last updated your account. Without the correct verification information, you will not be able to obtain a new password. You can obtain any other information with Customer Care."
