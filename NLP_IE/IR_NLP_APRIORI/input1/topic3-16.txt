"If my high school grades are so-so, should I go to community college before a 4 year college?","Most state universities will have transfer agreements with local community colleges, so spending all four years in one place is not a prerequisite to earning your diploma there. Additionally, you may find that getting into general ed classes at some state universities is quite difficult, while the equivalent courses at a community college are plentiful and offered at more convenient times.     I know many people who have saved a lot of money and have been quite successful spending a couple of years in community college and then transferring to a four-year university. Good luck, whatever you decide!"
