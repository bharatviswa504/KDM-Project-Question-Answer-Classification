Why is the shifter in a Prius like a joystick? and does it worsen the driving experience?,"The Prius has a CVT (continuously variable transmission) which does not employ normal gears. As a result, the shifter is just a switch and can take any form that the designers choose to implement. Additionally, since it is totally automatic and transparent in operation, it has a minimal impact on the driving experience as one rapidly grows accustomed to the controls and the driver doesn't interact with it except when putting it in park, drive, or reverse, not actions that occur more than a couple times each trip."
