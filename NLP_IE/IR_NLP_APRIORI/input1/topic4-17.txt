What's the difference between salted and unsalted butter?,"Salted butter:  Salt is added to butter for flavor and as a preservative so it will have a longer shelf life. Salt, however, can sometimes overpower the sweet flavor of the butter and can also mask odors.    Unsalted butter:  has a short shelf life because it contains no preservatives. Using unsalted butter allows the chef to control the amount of salt in a recipe."
