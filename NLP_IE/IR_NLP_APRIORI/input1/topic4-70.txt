"Refried, black and pinto beans, what are the differences?","Mmm, delicious whichever you choose. But to be specific, black beans (also known as turtle beans) are pea-sized, jet-black oval beans with an earthy, almost smoky flavor and a soft, mealy texture. Pintos are medium-sized long painted beans, with reddish tan skins usually mottled with brown flecks. Though purists might insist upon pintos, these days refried beans of both varieties are available at taquerias and grocery markets (with the other canned foods). Refried beans aren't really fried twice so much as fried well. To refry, add the beans of your choosing to a hot, heavy pan (cast irons recommended) that's been coated in oil (or, if you're going to be traditional, lard) and finely chopped onion and garlic. Mash away with your masher or fork, adding salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer your beans completely creamy, mash until smooth. If not, set aside a cupful and add to the smashed mixture, then reheat. Whenever I make refried beans, I always find myself bored with just the beans themselves, so I'll add finely chopped red and green peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes, or jalapenos. Best,    `k."
