What is the best cruise line for someone in their 20's?,"Carnival has done a good job of branding themselves as The Fun Ships with a singles party atmosphere, but there are other great choices for singles depending on your interest, preferences or budget. Royal Carribbean also has built some *huge* ships with interesting sports amenities (rock climbing wall, ice rink, surfing pool(!!), etc) which are good for active singles. And I've heard they also are a great place to meet people. If you want to go on a smaller, more intimate ship, I've heard Windstar is great. It's more luxurious but also more expensive. The cruise lines to avoid (which tend to have an older over 50 crowd) are Holland America and Princess (also more expensive than RC or Carnival) The Cruise Critic website is a great source of cruise and cruise line reviews."
