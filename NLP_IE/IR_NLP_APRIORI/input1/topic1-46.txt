Where did the name Mercedes Benz come from?,"Automobile manufacturers Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschat and Benz were competitors in Germany in the early 1900's. In 1926, the two companies merged.   A symbol was chosen for the combined products of DMG and Benz. The new insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed with laurel. The word Mercedes was at the top and the word Benz was at the bottom."
