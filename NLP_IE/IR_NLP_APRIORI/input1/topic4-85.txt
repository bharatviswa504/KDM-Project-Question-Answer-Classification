Anyone know what magic goes into creating a rice krispy? is it simply a popped grain of rice like popcorn or something fancier?,"They are made of a sugary rice mixture which is shaped into the form of rice kernels and toasted. These kernels bubble and rise in a manner which forms very thin walls. When the cereal is exposed to milk or juices, these walls tend to collapse suddenly, creating the famous Snap, crackle and pop sounds. This is in contrast to puffed rice, which was introduced in 1904."
