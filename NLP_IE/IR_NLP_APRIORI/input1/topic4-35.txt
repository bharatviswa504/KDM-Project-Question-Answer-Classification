Does anyone have a recipe for teriyaki salmon?,"Here's one from from Food Network Kitchens. It's called Teriyaki Salmon with Mirin Cucumber Salad. Enjoy!    1 cup thin soy sauce   Juice and zest of 2 oranges   3 tablespoons brown sugar   4 cloves of garlic   1 tablespoon minced ginger   1 tablespoon white sesame seeds   4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets    Combine all but sesame seeds and salmon in a saucepan. Bring to boil and slowly simmer until a syrupy consistency is achieved, about a 50 percent reduction. Let cool completely.   Add sesame seeds and salmon and marinate for 1 hour. Remove salmon from marinade and bring sauce to a boil. On a hot grill, cook salmon for about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Occasionally, brush the salmon with the teriyaki sauce.    MIRIN CUCUMBER SALAD:   1/2 tablespoon wasabi powder   1 tablespoon mirin   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar   1 teaspoon sugar   1/2 cup canola oil   Salt and white pepper to taste   2 large English cucumbers, julienned   Sesame seeds, for garnish    Make a paste with the wasabi and mirin. Whisk in vinegar and sugar. Whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the cucumbers with enough vinaigrette to coat completely. Lay grilled salmon on top of small pile of salad. Garnish with sesame seeds."
