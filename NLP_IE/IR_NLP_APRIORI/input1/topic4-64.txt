Anyone have a recipe for hawaiian laulau?,"Here's a recipe for the traditional laulau:    24 luau (taro) leaves (or substitute fresh spinach)   450 g (1 lb.) salted butterfish or salmon (or substitute salted cod)   1 1/2 tbsp. Hawaiian rock salt (kosher)   900 g (2 lb.) pork shoulder, cut in 2-5 cm (1-2) cubes   8 ti leaves (or substitute corn husks or parchment paper)   String for tying   4 plantains, skin on   4 sweet corn or yams, skin on     Method     Wash the taro leaves thoroughly. Remove the stems and fibrous part of the vein. If the fish is very salty, cover it with water in a bowl, soak for 1 - 2 hours, and drain. Rub the salt into the pork and set aside.     Arrange 5-6 taro leaves in the palm of your hand and place a piece of pork and a piece of fish in the middle. Fold the leaves over the pork and fish to form a bundle.     Prepare the ti leaves by cutting the stiff center rib and stripping it off to make the leaf pliable.     Place the taro leaf bundle at one end of the leaf and roll it up. Place another ti leaf across the bundle in the other direction and roll. Tie the ti leaf bundles securely with household string and knot.     Place the raw laulau bundle in a steamer with water in the bottom. Steam the laulau for 4-6 hours, checking the water and adding more as necessary. The time will vary according to the density of the laulau. Add the bananas and sweet potatoes to the steamer during the last hour."
