"Every time I try to make it, it turns out purple!","This recipe depends on flavor and color developed from the process of properly browning the chicken and bacon -- making sure you develop the brown crusty caramelization in the bottom of the pan while browning. With reduction of the sauce, you should not have issues with purple chicken. Keeping the skin on the chicken helps as well. You should not use non-stick pans for any recipe where the sauce needs to have the additional flavor from carmelization. Also, you can always substitute a full flavored- but not too fruity or sweet -- white wine for this dish. The flavor difference would be negligible.    Here is good recipe from Anne Willan's cooking school:"
