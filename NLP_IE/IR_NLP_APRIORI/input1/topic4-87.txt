What is the best tasting Turkey substitute?,"For vegetarian Turkey substitutes, I personally prefer the Quorn roast over Tofurkey. It's cheaper, smaller (both of which are better for the lone vegetarian in a crowd of meat eaters), and tastes better to me. Downside - I don't think there is a Quorn roast sold with stuffing, so you'll have to figure out how to make sure you get a vegetarian version of that."
