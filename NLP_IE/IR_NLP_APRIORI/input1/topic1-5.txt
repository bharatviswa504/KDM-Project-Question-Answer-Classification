"I want to go to san francisco from Palo Alto without a car, and I want to know if there is a ticket that can do this, in particular, one that would work for the whole day.","If you're going this route regularly, then Caltrain Monthly pass holders can purchase a Muni sticker along with their pass at all Caltrain ticket offices, Ticket Vending Machines and through the Ticket-by-Mail program. The Muni sticker isnâ€™t available with the 10-ride Ticket. The Muni sticker allows Caltrain passholders unlimited rides on all Muni services, except cable cars, for a monthly cost of $40, a $5 discount off the cost of a Muni Fast Pass.    If you're just looking for something for the day, then I would say take CalTrain from Palo Alto to the City and then get a 1 day Muni Passport ($9)"
