What's falafel?,"Falafel are a Middle Eastern specialty consisting of small, deep fried balls made of highly spiced, ground vegetables (usually chickpeas or fava beans mixed with onions and fresh herbs). They're generally tucked inside pita bread, sandwich-style, but can also be served as appetizers (with delicious hummus or baba ghanoush). A yogurt or tahini-based sauce is often served with falafel.
