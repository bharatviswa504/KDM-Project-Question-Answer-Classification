How would these courses improve overall teacher quality?,"Being an Master Educator myself, I would say that courses should be required that not only provide teachers-in-training a mastery of their content area, but also a better understanding of pedagogy, classroom management, and how to integrate technology into their classroom. I would also agree with the previous poster about ethics training. The content area knowledge would make them more knowledgable and therefore more capable of effectively communicating the important aspects of what they are teaching preferably in ways other than the standard lecture. Similarly, I am seeing that many new teachers are coming out with a less than ideal level of knowledge with regard to the pedagogical implications of their teaching techniques. By spending more time on how to effectively differentiate instruction and deliver exciting lessons, many new teachers would be ahead of the game. Additionally, classroom management is an important skill that is normally only taught (experientially) during field experiences. Knowing that this is generally an area of concern for new teachers more emphasis should be placed on it. Finally, integrating technology would help teachers to move away from standard textbooks, which while adequate, don't provide students the depth of knowledge they need to really understand the materials they are learning. The sum-total of all of these parts is a more well rounded teacher who is better prepared to engage students and enjoy a very rewarding career as a teacher."
