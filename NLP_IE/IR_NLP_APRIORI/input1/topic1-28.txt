Which Mercedes-Benzes are rare?,No current Mercedes is truly rare like the classics but the more rare models are-    AMG Models  V12 models (600 series)  Mercedes SLR ($400K) made by McLaren and AMG    Classic mercedes which are renowned as classics are    190SL convertible  300SL Gullwing  1936 500K    My personal favorite was the little known but well loved 190E 2.3-16 of 1986-1988. This was basically a little sports sedan tuned by Cosworth Racing. Not that fast by today's standards but a beautiful and sporty little car.
