how hot does turkey stuffing have to be?,"The turkey breast should register 180 degrees and the stuffing should be 165. But the key to getting the stuffing hot enough without overcooking the turkey is to pack the stuffing carefully. Fill the inside of the bird with stuffing, but don't press it in. If you would like additional stuffing, roast it in a separate roasting pan with chicken stock for added flavor. The best tasting stuffing will be inside the turkey, but this way you can be sure there will be enough to go around and no one will get sick! If stuffing a turkey, use a meat thermometer. If stuffing does not reach 165 °F when the turkey itself is done to 180 °F, further cooking will be required. During the added cooking necessary to bring the stuffing up to a safe temperature, the meat may become overcooked."
