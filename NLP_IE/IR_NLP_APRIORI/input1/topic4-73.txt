"I want to throw a birthday party for my husband, but I'm coming up short on ideas. I want to do something around food and drinks, like hors d'oeuvres and a chocolate fountain, but I'm open to themes too--any ideas?","Two themes that are easy to execute buffet style are middle eastern (lots of finger foods and things that can be prepared ahead) and mexican (casserole-type dishes like enchiladas and chilaquiles, chips and salsa and guacamole). You can probably find places that will cater these foods. You might want to do a nod to your husband's heritage by serving foods his family makes, or remember a good time in the past-- like a tropical theme with pictures of your warm weather vacation. If the party is near a holiday or event, you could use that as a theme (the Big Game, decorate your own hand turkey around Thanksgiving!) You can't go wrong with serving his favorite foods-- you know he'll be happy."
