How come fire trucks are red?,"Firetrucks are painted to be easily visible for safety reasons. Not all firetrucks are red and the decision on color is made at a local level. Many cities are beginning to use a bright yellow-lime color instead of red. Studies have shown that this is much more visible to a wide variety of people. Going to a fashionable, but not functional color like like black or gray would never happen for safety reasons."
