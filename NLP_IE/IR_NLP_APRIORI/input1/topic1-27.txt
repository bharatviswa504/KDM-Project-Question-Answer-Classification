"I have a in-law who is thinking of getting a KIA Van (Sedonna??). I guess there is a deal if buy a brand new Sedonna (sp??), you get a new KIA Rio(sp??) free.","They are a good value and the Koreans have made amazing strides in the past few years. While the first Kias were rolling suicide booths, it looks like the Sedona actually does well in crash tests (see link). The Rio has also been updated for 2006, so if there really is a 2 for 1 deal, the 06 would not be bad. The 05 is pretty horrible though. Also, nothing is free so your friend can probably pick up a sedona without a crappy 2005 rio for even less."
