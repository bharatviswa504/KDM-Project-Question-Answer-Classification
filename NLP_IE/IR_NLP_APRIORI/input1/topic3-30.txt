Who said Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?,"Plato quoted it: Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may. N.B.: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
