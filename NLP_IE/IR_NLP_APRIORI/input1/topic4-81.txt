What is panna cotta?,"Panna cotta means cooked cream in Italian and is very similar in consistency to a custard or flan but without the eggs. Typically it's served with fruit, syrup, or honey. One of my favorite recipes courtesy of Eric Ripert's Return to Cooking: Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Grapefruit Makes 4 servings Preparation Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 35 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling time Ingredients: 1 1/4 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup sugar 1 package granulated gelatin 1 3/4 cups buttermilk Vegetable oil cooking spray 3 large pink grapefruit 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons Vermont honey (or substitute another honey) Method: 1. Bring the cream and sugar to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Combine the gelatin and buttermilk. Once the cream has cooled, add the buttermilk-gelatin mixture and stir to combine. 2. Spray four (6-ounce) ramekins with vegetable spray. Divide the buttermilk-cream mixture between the ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. 3. Meanwhile, cut off the ends of the grapefruit. Using the tip of your knife, cut the peel and pith from the grapefruit. Hold the grapefruit over a bowl to catch the juice and cut out the segments from the fruit. Squeeze the membrane to release all the grapefruit juice. Refrigerate the grapefruit segments. Place the grapefruit juice (you should have at least 1 cup) in a small pot and add the vanilla extract. Bring to a boil and reduce by one third, about 30 minutes . Set aside. 4. To serve, dip the ramekins in hot water for 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around the edge of each ramekin and invert it onto the center of a plate. Arrange the grapefruit segments around the panna cotta in a spiraling fashion. Spoon the sauce over the grapefruit and drizzle the honey over the sauce. Serve immediately."
