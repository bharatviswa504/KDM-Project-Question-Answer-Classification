"Which is better in terms of reliability and value for money, a C240 Sedan or C230 Coupe?","The C230 Coupe is a better value for money. The Coupe was launched in europe at a HIGHER price point than the sedan, but because hatchbacks do not sell well in europe, MB USA decided to price it lower in the US. If you don't need rear seats the coupe offers more cargo versatility as well as the skyview roof, which gives you many of the advantages of a convertible with the security of a fixed roof. The C230 Coupe also has every safety feature available on the C240 sedan.    The C240 has a 168 HP V6 engine which is fairly weak, particularly with the sedan. There are two C230 coupes. They both have around 190 hp, but the newer models have a 1.8L aluminum engine, whereas the older models have a 2.3L iron engine. Both are reliable, but the 1.8 is the newer model. The way you can tell is by looking at the trim behind the front wheel. The 2.3 has no badge there but the 1.8 says 1.8 on the rubstrip. The 1.8L is supposed to handle and drive better and was released in 2003 I believe."
