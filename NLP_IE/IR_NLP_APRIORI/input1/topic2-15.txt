i just bought a mac for the first time and have no idea how to install the windows media plug-in. i've downloaded it from microsoft.com and have the windows media.sitx file on my desktop. thanks for the help!,"you'll need a version of stuffit that will let you expand that archive. think of it like you downloaded a zip file and you need something like winzip. once it unstuffs itself, you'll likely have an installer to launch to start the install process"
