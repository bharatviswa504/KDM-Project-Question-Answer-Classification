Are we safe from terrorist attacks? Is the homeland security effective?,"It all depends on your definition of safe. For example, if you consider yourself safe when you are driving down the road, then you are also safe from terrorist attacks. About 40,000 people die in the U.S. yearly from car accidents. As far as airline security goes, two things which have been done have made the airlines more secure: 1. Securing the cockpit with stronger doors and restrictions on opening them 2. The knowledge of airline crew and passengers that they should fight back against hijackers rather than letting them control the plane."
