what is the best way to get a car door dent fixed?,"Depends on the size of the dent. If the dent is small (like the size of a half dollar) and there is no paint damage, the best option is paintless dent removal, do a search on the maps beta for paintless dent removal in your area and you can see where the shops are. (see link). PDR is much cheaper than normal methods, I've paid around $50/dent and been very satisfied with the results."
