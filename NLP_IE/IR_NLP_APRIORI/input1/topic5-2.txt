What is the cause of the recent riots in Paris?,"Two muslim youths were electrocuted in a power substation while hiding allegedly because they were being pursued by the police. The police have denied this claim. Their deaths led the immigrant population to start rioting. Reasons cited were that immigrant youths don't feel integrated into French society, and feel marginalized by politicians who refer to them as thugs."
