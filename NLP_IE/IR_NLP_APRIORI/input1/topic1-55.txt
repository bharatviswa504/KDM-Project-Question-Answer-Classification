Is one better than the other?,"Depends on the kind of driving you do. There are two types of hybrid systems, parallel and series. A parallel hybrid, like the Toyota and Ford systems, employs a separate electric motor and gas engine,connected in parallel to the wheels. Systems like these tend to be better for city driving, and this is usually reflected in the higher EPA city ratings for parallel hybrids. Parallel hybrids have, until very recently, been the only system that allows independent operation of the electric and gas motors, where the car can operate in pure electric mode at low speeds when the battery has a good charge. The Honda employs a series hybrid where the motor is integrated into the transmission and is connected in series to the drive wheels. These systems typically offer better highway mileage than parallel hybrids but slightly worse around town. Also typical with these systems is the inability to run the car in pure electric mode, though this has changed with the 2006 Civic Hybrid. While the Prius has been the state of the art in hybrid technology, it is my opinion that the new 2006 Civic Hybrid is the superior vehicle. It was designed from the ground up with the Prius as a benchmark, and the designers have hit their mark. I think the Civic will end up being a better driving experience. The platform was engineered to be the basis for the next generation of Honda vehicles, and the 2006 Civic Si, also based on the same platform, is considered to be the best in its class. The hybrid shares the same basic suspension as the Si, and will undoubtedly be compatible with the multitude of aftermarket suspension upgrades which will become available shortly for the 2006 civic."
