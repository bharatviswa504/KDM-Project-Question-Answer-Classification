"I'll be in the San Jose area, and would like to eat authentic food. Any suggestions?","Las Delecias Del Maiz is as authentic as you can get--the restaurant is full of locals, and the food is incredibly delicious. Every Wednesday, they make a tasty beef and vegetable soup. If you don't know what to try, get the Fiesta de Gallo, which is a sampler plate with Arroz con Pollo, grilled beef and pork, Picadillos de Papa, plantains, and tortilla. Also try the corn pancake dipped in yogurt. http://www.deliciasdelmaiz.com"
