How to pick cantaloupes?,"More ways to pick the right cantaloupes:    1. The best thing you can do is smell. This doesn't apply for watermelons. Watermelons are described below. As for cantaloupe: don't look, don't touch, just smell. Ripe cantaloupe smells very sweet and nice. Sniffing out the most aromatic one is the smartest way to pick a cantaloupe or honeydew.   2. Thump test: hold your dominant hand as if ready to knock on a door. Deliver two or three good thumps to the round side of a melon. The sound should be deep and thick, indicating a dense, full fruit. A higher hollow sound can mean unripeness.   3. If a honeydew is beige-skinned with distinct green veins it's probably not ripe yet. If it has a pale yellow color with bright, lemon-colored areas you probably have found a good one.   Cantaloupes are unripe when the skin beneath the textured web is green. Cantaloupes are ripe when orange or gold.   4. Another mark of desirability is a patch that's slightly flat and bleached in color. Melons that develop on the vine flatten under their own weight, and lose color where they sit on hot soil. In general, stem ends should be moist, not moldy. A good melon is firm, but not rock hard. It yields very slightly to pressure but has no soft spots.   5. Ripe cantaloupes rattle only occasionally, so it's an unreliable indicator.     To determine ripeness of cantaloupes and honeydews in order to pick them from the plant, the following indices of maturity are known:     Grasp it firmly, give a tug and a twist. If it falls easily off the vine into your hand, it's ripe."
