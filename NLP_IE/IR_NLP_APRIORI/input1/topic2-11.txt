"I'd like to set the value of a cell based on the whether another cell contains a certain string. <br><br>For example, if the word in cell A1 contains the blah string, then set this cell equal to 1. <br><br>Does anyone know how to do this?","Your best bet is to use an IF statement. And IF statement returns one value if a condition you specify evaluates to TRUE and another value if it evaluates to FALSE. The format for an IF statement is...    If(logical_test, value_if_true,value_if_false)    So in your case you might do something like this in the cell you want to be populated based on the contents of A1...    If(A1=blah, yes it does, no it does not)    If A1 could contain other text other than blah and you want to check for that you could do something like...    =IF(ISNUMBER(FIND(blah,A1)),OK, Not OK)    This will check all the text in A1 for the string blah and return OK if it finds something and NOT OK if it doesn't.    Check the online help of Excel for more information and syntax for the IF and FIND statements. I bet one of them will do what you are looking for.    SR"
