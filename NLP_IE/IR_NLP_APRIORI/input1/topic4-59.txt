Do I have to remove the dark vein when cooking shrimps?,"According to the Food Network, the vein in the small and medium shrimp is only removed for cosmetic purposes. However, the vein is actually used for intestinal purposes, so larger shrimp are usually packing grit which can effect the taste of the dish.  Use the tip of a knife to cut along the backside of the shrimp and remove the vein. the is a cooking tool called a deveiner sold in stores, but i find it easier to ask the butcher for deveined shrimp at the grocery store."
