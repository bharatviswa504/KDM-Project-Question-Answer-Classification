How many miles should I go before I need to get the oil changed?,"Since you drive a BMW, the car will tell you when to change the oil. Oil life is determined by a variety of factors including highway vs city mileage, temperature, average rpm, load factor, etc. The every 5000K miles recommendation from most car companies is a calculated guess but BMW's have a system that take these factors into account. So basically when the car tells you to do it, you should do it. You can even do it yourself, it only takes about 20 minutes of your time once you learn."
