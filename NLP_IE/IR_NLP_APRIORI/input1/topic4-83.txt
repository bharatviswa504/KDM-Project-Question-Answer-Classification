i know of a number of paid services but would like to save money and get ratings/reviews without paying.,"Free is tough, but if it's what you want, then look no further than www.wineaccess.com. It's actually an aggregator of wine retailers (and more, but I won't get into it)--the catch is that you can only check out Steven Tanzer's reviews if one of their wine retailers has the wine in stock. Not sure how broad ST's reviews go, but he seems to cover a lot of US and French wines. They have supplemental reviews by other another rater called CGCW."
