Can any one recommend good gifts to bring back for friends from a trip to San Francisco. I'd like them to be inexpensive (less than $40) and unique and emblemnatic of SF. <br><br>Your help is appreciated! Thanks.,"I would go to the SF Ferry Building and pick from the fantastic selection of shops/goodies there...in particular, some chocolate from Scharffenberger or Michael Recchuiti (both bay area natives and expert chocolatiers)--you can easily find stuff for under $40.     If you go on a Saturday morning, I'd go to the the Farmer's Market (which is in back of the Ferry Building) and pick up some June Taylor preserves, which are beautifully packaged, seasonal and delicious. Each jar is about $11."
