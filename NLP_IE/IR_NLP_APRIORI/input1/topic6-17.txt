Which hotel in Vegas has the best thrill ride?,"Stratosphere has some crazy rides at the top of the tower. These rides wouldn't be as exciting if they were on the ground. However, being over 100 stories in the air, these rides definately give a rush. I won't recommend these if you have a fear of heights. The Manhanttan Express roller coaster at New York New York is great because it's also elevated above ground level and it has an unususal heartline twist. If you want a lot of rides in one place, check out the Adventuredome at Circus Circus."
