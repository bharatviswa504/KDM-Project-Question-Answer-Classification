How to boil lobster?,"Fill a large pot with 1/4 full of water or just enough to cover your lobster and add a generous handful of salt. When it comes to a boil, put the lobster in the pot head first. Then boil for 18 for the first pound and 10 minutes more for each additional pound. For lobsters over 7 pounds, 8 minutes per additional pound is enough."
