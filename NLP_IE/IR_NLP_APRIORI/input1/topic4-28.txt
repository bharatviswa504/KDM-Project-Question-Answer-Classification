Why do we need to wash rice before cooking?,"Before, there was a need to rinse rice to remove dirt like twigs and stones.     Long-grain white rice is rinsed before cooking to remove excess starch. Removing the starch makes the rice cook more evenly and it makes the cooked rice less sticky.     In the States, if you rinse the rice, you are rinsing away vitamins, minerals, and iron. Rice is fortified with vitamins, minerals and iron that is applied on the rice. It's up to you whether you want to wash your rice before cooking it."
