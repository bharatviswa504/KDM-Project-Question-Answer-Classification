"I'm going to Seattle for the first time, for just a weekend. What are the sites I shouldn't miss? I heard there's a good winery in the area too...","If you have just a weekend, you can go to the Space Needle + Experience Music Project (they are adjacent) and monorail over to downtown where you can walk to Pike's Place Market. Now... if you are interested in night life, you can hit Capitol club, Baltic room, and Linda's all within walking distance from each other on pine street in Capitol Hill. Capitol Hill is just up the Hill to the East from downtown. If you go there during the day, there are also a bunch on funky shops on Broadway, Pike and Pine Streets."
