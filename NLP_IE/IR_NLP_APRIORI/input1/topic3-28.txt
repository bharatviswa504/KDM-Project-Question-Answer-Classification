Is there enough emphasis on gang prevention in the middle schools?,"I don't think there is. However, I think as important as preventing them from forming is appreciating why the y form in the first place. Only when teachers, administrators and parents understand why they form can we collectively work effectively to solve the gang / gang violence problem."
