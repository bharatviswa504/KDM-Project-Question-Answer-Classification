Is Lexus anticipating on releasing more models that run on electric / battery power & gasoline?,"Yes, the Lexus flagship is going to be available as a hybrid- the LS600h. However, like all Toyota hybrids except the prius, the hybrid technology is biased more towards performance than economy and has no special status with regards to driving in the HOV lanes. It will be at least $70K and be extremely fast but no more efficient than mid-high 20's."
