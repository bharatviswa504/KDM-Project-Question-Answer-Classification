I need a recommendation for a nice hotel in San Diego (or at least near it) for the weekend. Going down for the MNF game 10/10. Want a nice pool/beach for kids etc.,"The Hotel Del Coronado is one of the most famous and historic hotels in California, a real treat and great experience for the family."
