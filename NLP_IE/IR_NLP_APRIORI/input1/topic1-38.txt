Why should I purchase a Lexus over a Mercedes and BMW?,"The Lexus is a car for people who don't really like cars. They want cars to be comfortable, safe, cheap to own (particularly when you factor in depreciation), and high quality. In other words, if you view a car as an appliance and you just want it to do its job in as unobtrusive a way as possible, get the Lexus. They are trying to change this with their new models, but change comes slowly.    Mercedes-Benz cars are typically less luxurious and arguably built to a lower standard. They are filled with cutting-edge technology (Lexus is usually a couple years behind) and are quite enjoyable to drive, and are just as safe. They are also not quite as reliable, and they depreciate more quickly. Buy a Mercedes if you want luxury but also enjoy driving. If you really enjoy driving and don't mind a firmer ride, get a BMW."
