Is it true that wines get better with age? Why?,"Some wines do, some wines don't. Generally speaking, some wines, particularly whites, should be enjoyed within a couple of years of the vintage date on the bottle. The wines that do get better with age are rich red wines like the top California Cabernets and French Red Bordeaux."
