What makes AMG different from other Mercedes-Benz vehicles?,"AMG (Aufrecht Melcher Grossaspach) was the leading independent tuner of Mercedes-Benz automobiles when they were purchased by the company in the mid 1990's. AMG vehicles are meant to be the highest performing model for a specific model line (though not necessarily the most luxurious). They have handbuilt motors, upgraded brakes and suspension, and exclusive interior and exterior featuers. Since they are factory built they are covered by a manufacturer's warranty. They are also produced in relatively limited numbers. They can be identified by the badge on the trunk, as well as the two digit model designation. (i.e. C32 vs C320)"
